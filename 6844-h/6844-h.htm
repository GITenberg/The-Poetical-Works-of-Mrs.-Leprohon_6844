      THE POETICAL WORKS OF MRS. LEPROHON<br>

    </h1>
    <p>
      When, in after ages, the literature of Canada comes to be written, it is
      to be hoped that among the mighty sons and daughters of genius now
      unknown, or as yet unborn, some room will be kept for the brave and
      loving pioneers who &ldquo;gave the people of their best,&rdquo; and sang
      the songs of duty and patriotism and hope, ere life in our young land had
      ceased to be a struggle. With the growth of wealth and the spread of
      prosperity, will come leisure for more than material interests; and thus,
      in course of time, the author who has something to say will find an
      audience, prepared by culture and not too busy to listen to it. And, as
      supply is generally commensurate with demand, there will then be a
      literary class of corresponding merit. At least, something like this has
      been the rule in the progress of nations. But if those who come after,
      thus favored by circumstances, surpass their predecessors in literary
      skill or power, not less deserving are the latter who, with little
      prospect of reward, bore the burden and the heat of the day. This early
      stage in a nation&rsquo;s literature has, indeed, an interest and a value
      of its own, which only meet with due appreciation from a judicious and
      grateful posterity. If it has not the rich, warm splendor of the later
      morning, it has the welcome promise of the dawn, and a tender beauty of
      its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this band of pioneers Mrs. Leprohon must be conceded a distinguished
      place. None of them has employed rare gifts of head and heart to better
      purpose; none of them had a wider range of sympathy; none of them did
      more willing service, with the purest motives, in all good causes. And,
      it may be added, none of them was more happy in attaining, during life,
      the admiration and friendship of a large though select circle of every
      creed and race among her compatriots. It is in order to place in the
      hands of those who thus loved and honored her a memorial of what she was
      at her best, intellectually and morally, that this little volume has been
      prepared. It contains the emotional record of a blameless and beautiful
      life, the outcome of a mind that thought no evil of any one, but
      overflowed with loving kindness to all. Before pointing out, however,
      what we consider the salient qualities in Mrs. Leprohon&rsquo;s poetry,
      it may be well to give our readers a brief sketch of her too short
      career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosanna Eleanor Mullins was born in the city of Montreal in the year
      1832. It is almost unnecessary to state that she was educated at the
      Convent of the Congregation of Notre Dame, so numerous are her
      affectionate tributes to the memories of dear friends associated with
      that institution. Long before her education was completed, she had given
      evidence of no common literary ability. She was, indeed, only fourteen
      years old when she made her earliest essays in verse and prose. Before
      she had bid adieu to the years and scenes of girlhood, she had already
      won a reputation as a writer of considerable promise, and as long as Mr.
      John Lovell conducted the <i>Literary Garland</i>, Miss Mullins was one
      of his leading contributors. She continued to write for that excellent
      magazine until lack of financial success compelled its enterprising
      proprietor to suspend its publication. It was some time before another
      such opportunity was given to the Canadian votaries of the muses of
      reaching the cultivated public. In the meanwhile, however, the subject of
      our sketch&mdash;who had, in 1851, become the wife of Dr. J. L. Leprohon,
      a member of one of the most distinguished Canadian families&mdash;was far
      from being idle. Some of her productions she sent to the Boston
      <i>Pilot</i>, the faithful representative in the United States of the
      land and the creed to which Mrs. Leprohon was proud to belong. She was
      also a frequent and welcome contributor to several of the Montreal
      journals. It is a pleasing evidence of her gentle thoughtfulness for a
      class which many persons in her position regard with indifference that
      she wrote, year after year, the &ldquo;News-boy&rsquo;s Address&rdquo;
      for the <i>True Witness</i>, the <i>Daily News</i> and other newspapers.
      One of her most pathetic poems, &ldquo;The Death of the Pauper
      Child&rdquo; may also be mentioned as a striking instance of that sweet
      charity which comprehended in its sisterly range the poor, the desolate
      and the suffering. The <i>Journal of Education</i>, edited by the Hon. P.
      J. O. Chauveau, himself an honor to Canadian Literature; the <i>Canadian
      Illustrated News</i>, edited by Mr. John Lesperance, distinguished both
      as a poet and a novelist; the <i>Saturday Reader</i>, the
      <i>Hearthstone</i>, and other periodicals, both in Canada and elsewhere,
      were always glad to number Mrs. Leprohon&rsquo;s productions among their
      most attractive features. She had always a ready pen, the result of a
      full heart and far-reaching sympathies, and, therefore, was frequently
      asked to write on subjects of current interest. Among her
      &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; poems; several of which are in this volume, may
      be mentioned the touching stanzas on the &ldquo;Monument to the Irish
      Emigrants,&rdquo; those on the &ldquo;Old Towers&rdquo; at the
      &ldquo;Priest&rsquo;s Farm,&rdquo; those on the renewal of her vows by
      the Lady Abbess of the Congregation of Notre Dame, the poem on the
      &ldquo;Recollet Church,&rdquo; and the address &ldquo;To the Soldiers of
      Pius The Ninth.&rdquo; One of her most important efforts of this kind was
      her translation of the Cantata composed by M. Semp&eacute; on the
      occasion of the visit of the Prince of Wales to Canada in 1860.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have attempted such a classification of the poems as we thought would
      best show the range of Mrs. Leprohon&rsquo;s powers. Under every one of
      the headings which we have adopted the reader will find something to
      profit and delight. The lover of nature will find himself carried in
      fancy to the fairest or grandest of Canadian scenes; he who loves to
      indulge in reveries of the past can with her stand with Jacques Cartier
      on Mount Royal three centuries ago and survey the mighty expanse of
      forest, destined one day to be the home of a thriving people; those whose
      pleasure it is to read of heroic deeds will hear her sing of ennobling
      courage and fortitude that blenched not at death. But by many, we think,
      Mrs. Leprohon will be most cherished as she tells in sweet and simple
      rhyme of the tenderness of a mother&rsquo;s love, of a wife&rsquo;s
      devotion, a husband&rsquo;s loyal trust, of the pious offices of the
      domestic altar, of the parting by the death-bed that is not without hope,
      of the loved and lost that yet are &ldquo;not lost but only gone
      before.&rdquo; To illustrate these varied characteristics by quotation
      would demand far more, than our allotted space. We can, therefore, only
      refer the reader to the book itself, confident that in its pages he will
      find all that we have indicated and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a word as to Mrs. Leprohon&rsquo;s prose writings. Though in this
      sketch we have dwelt upon her work as a poet, it is as a writer of
      fiction that she has won her most marked popular successes, that she has
      reached the hearts of the two great communities of which this province is
      composed. For no less than four of her most elaborate tales have been
      translated into French; these are, <i>Ida Beresford</i>, the <i>Manor
      House of Villerati, Antoinette de Mirecourt,</i> and <i>Armand
      Durand</i>. Besides these, she has written <i>Florence FitzHarding, Eva
      Huntingdon, Clarence FitzClarence</i> and <i>Eveleen O&rsquo;Donnell</i>.
      In the <i>Manor House of Villerai</i> she has described with a skilful
      pen the manners and customs of the forefathers of the French Canadian
      people, such as they were at the period of the great contest which
      changed the destinies of Canada. In <i>Armand Durand</i> we have a
      courageous struggle with adverse fortune, which is at last crowned with
      success. The sad consequences of secret marriage, unblessed by parental
      consent, are unfolded in <i>Antoinette de Mirecourt,</i> one of the
      finest of Mrs. Leprohon&rsquo;s novels, and of which the French
      translation has lately been honored by a new edition. Of her merits as a
      novelist one of the ablest of French Canadian critics writes thus:
      &ldquo;Gifted with a deep knowledge of the human heart, she finds in
      domestic life the subject of attractive pictures, full of delicacy and
      good taste, which she dramatizes with remarkable power. Her charm lies,
      not in any complication of intrigue or in problems hard to solve, but in
      a skilful working out of details, in incidents which fix the
      reader&rsquo;s attention, in the conception of her characters, in the
      painting of personal traits, in purity of thought, in sweetness of
      sentiment, in beauty of style, in the harmony of the parts, and in the
      most scrupulous regard for morality.&rdquo; This is high praise, and it
      comes from high authority. We will simply add that, with a few necessary
      changes, it may also be applied to Mrs. Leprohon&rsquo;s poems.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this imperfect sketch of Mrs. Leprohon&rsquo;s literary life it will
      be seen that she was no sluggard. But we would leave a wrong impression
      if we gave it to be understood that all her time was passed in the
      writing of either poems or tales. Far from it. They constituted but one
      phase in a life nobly, yet unostentatiously, consecrated to the duties of
      home, of society, of charity and of religion. Mrs. Leprohon was much more
      than either a poet or a novelist&mdash;she was, also, in the highest
      sense, a woman, a lady. Had she never written a verse of poetry or a page
      of prose, she would still have been lovingly remembered for what she was
      as wife, as mother, as friend. It is, in a great part, because they are
      associated with her in these more endearing aspects, that they are the
      true mental and moral offspring of her very self, that those who knew her
      will find in them so much to prize. Alas! these and loving memories, that
      can scarce be separated from them, are now all that is left of her. On
      the 20th of September, 1879, after a tedious illness, endured with
      Christian resignation, she passed away. She did not live to receive the
      reward that was her due on earth, but that which is above is hers, and
      her works live after her, and a memory that will not perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, we will just allow ourselves to point out that, in
      connection with her comparatively early death, there is a touching
      interest attached to some of her poems, such, especially, as &ldquo;The
      Parting Soul to her Guardian Angel&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Voices of the
      Death Chamber.&rdquo; In the former she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thy soft-breathed hopes with magic might<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have chased from my soul the shades of
      night.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Console the dear ones I part from now,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hang o&rsquo;er my couch with pallid
      brow;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Tell them, we&rsquo;ll meet in yon shining sky,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Angel Guardian, I now can die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the latter, which has all the vividness of an actual death-scene,
      as the husband and children from whom she must part are kneeling by the
      bed-side, the sufferer says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh! if earthly love could conquer<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty power of death,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>His</i> love would stay the current<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my failing strength and breath;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And that voice whose loving fondness<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been my earthly stay<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Could half tempt me from the voices<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That are calling me away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last they come nearer and sound louder, till they &ldquo;drown all
      sounds of mortal birth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;in their wild triumphal
      sweetness,&rdquo; lure her away from earth to Heaven.

    <p>
      The noontide sun streamed brightly down<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Moriah&rsquo;s mountain crest,<br>
       The golden blaze of his vivid rays<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Tinged sacred Jordan&rsquo;s breast;<br>
       While towering palms and flowerets sweet,<br>
       Drooped low &rsquo;neath Syria&rsquo;s burning heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sunny glare of the sultry air<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Toiled up the mountain side<br>
       The Patriarch sage in stately age,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And a youth in health&rsquo;s gay pride,<br>
       Bearing in eyes and in features fair<br>
       The stamp of his mother&rsquo;s beauty rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not known when one rosy dawn,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Ere they started on their way,<br>
       She had smoothed with care his clustering hair,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And knelt with him to pray,<br>
       That his father&rsquo;s hand and will alike<br>
       Were nerved at his young heart to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Heavenly Power that with such dower<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of love fills a mother&rsquo;s heart,<br>
       Ardent and pure, that can all endure,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of her life itself a part,<br>
       Knew too well that love beyond all price<br>
       To ask of <i>her</i> such a sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the noble boy with laughing joy<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Had borne up the mountain road<br>
       The altar wood, which in mournful mood<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;His sire had helped to load,<br>
       Type of Him who dragged up Calvary,<br>
       The cross on which he was doomed to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hot breath of noon began, full soon,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;On his youthful frame to tell;<br>
       On the ivory brow, flushed, wearied now,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;It laid its burning spell;<br>
       And listless&mdash;languid&mdash;he journeyed on,<br>
       The smiles from <i>his</i> lips and bright eyes gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once did he say, on their toilsome way,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Father, no victim is near,&rdquo;<br>
       But with heavy sigh and tear-dimmed eye,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;In accents sad though clear,<br>
       Abraham answered: &ldquo;The Lord, our guide,<br>
       A fitting sacrifice will provide.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The altar made and the fuel laid,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! the victim stretched thereon<br>
       Is Abraham&rsquo;s son, his only one,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Who at morning&rsquo;s blushing dawn<br>
       Had started with smiles that care defied<br>
       To travel on at his father&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      With grief-struck brow the Patriarch now<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Bares the sharp and glittering knife;<br>
       On that mournful pyre, oh hapless sire!<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Must he take his darling&rsquo;s life?<br>
       Will fails not, though his eyes are dim,<br>
       God gave his boy&mdash;he belongs to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With anguish riven, he casts towards Heaven<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;One look, imploring, wild,<br>
       That doth mutely pray for strength to slay<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;His own, his only child;<br>
       When forth on the air swells a glad command,<br>
       And an angel stays his trembling hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The offering done, the sire and son<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Come down Moriah&rsquo;s steep,<br>
       Joy gleaming now on Abraham&rsquo;s brow,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;In his heart thanksgiving deep;<br>
       While with love from His lofty and glorious Throne<br>
       Heaven&rsquo;s King hath smiled on sire and son.

       A female form, with timid step and downcast modest eye;&mdash;<br>
       A girl she seems by the fresh bloom that decks her lovely
      face&mdash;<br>
       With locks of gold and vestal brow, and form of childish grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, no! those soft, slight arms enfold a helpless new-born child,<br>
       Late entered on this world of woe&mdash;still pure and undefiled;<br>
       While two white doves she humbly lays before the altar there<br>
       Tell that, despite her girlish years, she knows a matron&rsquo;s care.

       When, wandering back through ages past,<br>

    <p>
      Awe-struck we picture to ourselves<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That brow serene and fair,<br>
       That gentle face, the long rich curls<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of wavy golden hair,<br>
       And those deep wondrous, star-like eyes,<br>
       Holy and calm as midnight skies.

       Knowing a matron&rsquo;s joy and pride,<br>

      Though with the boys of Nazareth<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;He never joined in mirth,<br>

    <h2>
      <a name="sacred25">OUR SAVIOUR AND THE SAMARITAN WOMAN AT THE WELL.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Close beside the crystal waters of Jacob&rsquo;s far-famed well,<br>
       Whose dewy coolness gratefully upon the parched air fell,<br>
       Reflecting back the bright hot heavens within its waveless breast,<br>
       Jesus, foot-sore and weary, had sat Him down to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone was He&mdash;His followers had gone to Sichar near,<br>
       Whose roofs and spires rose sharply against the heavens clear,<br>
       For food which Nature craveth, whate&rsquo;er each hope or care,<br>
       And which, though Lord of Nature, He disdained not to share.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus He calmly waited, came a woman to the well,<br>
       With water vase poised gracefully, and step that lightly fell,<br>
       One of Samaria&rsquo;s daughters, most fair, alas! but frail,<br>
       Her dark locks bound with flowers instead of modest, shelt&rsquo;ring
      veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      No thought of scornful anger within <i>His</i> bosom burned,<br>
       Nor, with abhorrent gesture, His face from her He turned;<br>
       But as His gaze of purity dwelt on her, searching, meek,<br>
       Her bright eyes fell, and blushes hot burned on her brow and cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her with a gentleness, by God-like pity nursed,<br>
       Of wond&rsquo;rous living fountains at which to slake her thirst;<br>
       That those whose lips, thrice blessed, should a draught from them
      obtain,<br>
       Despite earth&rsquo;s toils and troubles, would ne&rsquo;er know thirst
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke, too, of the frailties which her womanhood had marred,<br>
       That priceless crown which, she, alas! had sadly failed to guard,<br>
       No word of bold denial did that woman dare to plan&mdash;<br>
       She felt that He who spoke with her was more than mortal man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the twelve disciples returned, their errand done,<br>
       They wondered at His converse with that lost and erring one,<br>
       But still they asked no question, while she, with thoughtful mien,<br>
       Returned to tell her friends at home of all that she had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only for that daughter of Samaria&rsquo;s hot clime&mdash;<br>
       Child of an ancient people, of a by-gone faith and time&mdash;<br>
       Was meant the exhortation that from His lips then fell,<br>
       But for His Christian children, for us, to-day, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      For us, still pure and sparkling, those living waters flow<br>
       Of which He told Samaria&rsquo;s child long centuries ago:<br>
       Forgetting thoughts of earthly pride, and hopes of worldly gain,<br>
       Seek we but once of them to drink&mdash;we&rsquo;ll never thirst again.

    <h2>
      <a name="sacred34">THE TEN LEPERS.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &rsquo;Neath the olives of Samaria, in far-famed Galilee,<br>
       Where dark green vines are mirrored in a placid silver sea,<br>
       &rsquo;Mid scenes of tranquil beauty, glowing sun-sets, rosy dawn,<br>
       The Master and disciples to the city journeyed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as they neared a valley where a sheltered hamlet lay,<br>
       A strange, portentous wailing made them pause upon their way&mdash;<br>
       Voices fraught with anguish, telling of aching heart and brow,<br>
       Which kept moaning: &ldquo;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Softly raised the gentle Saviour His eyes like midnight star,<br>
       And His mournful gaze soon rested on ten lepers, who, afar,<br>
       Stood motionless and suppliant, in sackcloth rudely clothed,<br>
       Poor Pariahs! by their nearest, their dearest, shunned and loathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not unto Him prayed vainly those sore afflicted ten,<br>
       No! He yearned too fondly over the erring sons of men,<br>
       Even sharing in their sorrows, though He joined not in their
      feasts,&mdash;<br>
       So He kindly told the Lepers: &ldquo;Show yourselves unto the
      priests.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When, miracle of mercy! as they turned them to obey,<br>
       And towards the Holy Temple quickly took their hopeful way,<br>
       Lo! the hideous scales fell off them, health&rsquo;s fountains were
      unsealed,<br>
       Their skin grew soft as infant&rsquo;s&mdash;their leprosy was healed.
    </p>
    <p>
      O man! so oft an ingrate, to thy thankless nature true,<br>
       Thyself see in those Lepers, who did as thou dost do;<br>
       Nine went their way rejoicing, healed in body&mdash;glad in
      soul&mdash;<br>
       Nor once thought of returning thanks to Him who made them whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      One only, a Samaritan, a stranger to God&rsquo;s word,<br>
       Felt his joyous, panting bosom, with gratitude deep stirred,<br>
       And without delay he hastened, in the dust, at Jesus&rsquo; feet,<br>
       To cast himself in worship, in thanksgiving, warm and meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly questioned him the Saviour, with majesty divine:&mdash;<br>
       &ldquo;Ten were cleansed from their leprosy&mdash;where are the other
      nine?<br>
       Is there none but this one stranger&mdash;unlearned in Gods ways,<br>
       His name and mighty power, to give word of thanks or praise?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunbeams&rsquo; quivering glories softly touched that God-like
      head,<br>
       The olives blooming round Him sweet shade and fragrance shed,<br>
       While o&rsquo;er His sacred features a tender sadness stole:<br>
       &ldquo;Rise, go thy way,&rdquo; He murmured, &ldquo;thy faith hath made
      thee whole!&rdquo;

    <h2>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;With weary, hopeless mien,<br>
       On his furrowed brow the traces<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of care and want were seen;<br>
       With outstretched hand and with bowed-down head<br>
       He asked the passers-by for bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The palm-tree&rsquo;s feathery foliage<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Around him thickly grew,<br>
       And the smiling sky above him<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Wore Syria&rsquo;s sun-bright hue;<br>
       But dark alike to that helpless one<br>
       Was murky midnight or noon-tide sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      But voices breaking the silence<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Are heard, fast drawing nigh,<br>
       And falls on his ear the clamor<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of vast crowds moving by:<br>
       &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asks, with panting breath;<br>
       They answer: &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What a spell lay in that title,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Linked with such mem&rsquo;ries high<br>
       Of miracles of mercy,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Wrought &rsquo;neath Judaea&rsquo;s sky!<br>
       Loud calls he, with pleading voice and brow,<br>
       &ldquo;Oh! Jesus, on me have mercy now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How often had he listened<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;To wond&rsquo;rous tales of love&mdash;<br>
       Of the Galilean&rsquo;s mercy,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of power from above,<br>
       To none other given of mortal birth<br>
       To heal the afflicted sons of earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      With faith that never wavered<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Still louder rose his cry,<br>
       Despite the stern rebuking<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of many standing nigh,<br>
       Who bade him stifle his grief or joy,<br>
       Nor &ldquo;the Master rudely thus annoy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, soon that voice imploring<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Struck on the Saviour&rsquo;s ear,<br>
       He stopped, and to His followers<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;He said &ldquo;Go bring him here!&rdquo;<br>
       And, turning towards him that God like brow,<br>
       He asked the suppliant, &ldquo;What wouldest thou?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though with awe and hope all trembling,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet courage gaineth he,<br>
       And imploringly he murmurs:<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh Lord! I fain would see!&rdquo;<br>
       The Saviour says in accents low:<br>
       &ldquo;Thy faith hath saved thee&mdash;be it so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then on those darkened eye-balls<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;A wondrous radiance beamed,<br>
       And they drank in the glorious beauty<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That through all nature gleamed;<br>
       But the fairest sight they rested on<br>
       Was the Saviour, David&rsquo;s royal Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      O rapture past all telling!<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;The bliss that vision brought!<br>
       Could a whole life&rsquo;s praises thank <i>Him</i><br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;For the wonder He had wrought?<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;From sin&rsquo;s dark stain ever free,<br>
       Refuge of the sinner lowly,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;I come&mdash;I come to thee!<br>
       Now with wreaths of sinful pleasure<br>

    <p>
      See! I tear away the flowers<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;From my perfumed golden hair,<br>
       Closely tended in past hours<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;With such jealous, sinful care;<br>
       Never more for me they blossom,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Not for me those jewels vain:<br>
       On my arms or brow or bosom,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;They shall never shine again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dost thou wonder at my daring<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Thus to seek thy sacred shrine,<br>
       When the sinner&rsquo;s lot despairing,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Wretched&mdash;hopeless&mdash;should be mine?<br>
       To the instincts high of woman<br>

       But a bright hope tells that heaven<br>

       That I yet may be forgiven,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Mary, by thy spotless Son!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! I look on thy mild features,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Full of dove-like, tender love&mdash;<br>
       Once the humblest of God&rsquo;s creatures,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Now with Him enthroned above!<br>
       Every trait angelic breathing<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetest promises of peace;<br>
       And the smile thy soft lips wreathing<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me that my griefs shall cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soft the evening shadows gather<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;But no longer shall I wait,<br>
       I will rise and seek the Father,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;For it is not yet too late;<br>
       And when earthly cares oppress me,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;When life&rsquo;s paths my bruised feet pain;<br>
       Hither shall I come to rest me,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And new strength and courage gain!

    </h2>
    <h3>
      A LEGEND OF NIAGARA FALLS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In days long gone by it was the custom of the Indian warriors of the
      forest to assemble at the Great Cataract and offer a human sacrifice to
      the Spirit of the Falls. The offering consisted of a white canoe, full of
      ripe fruits and blooming flowers, which was paddled over the terrible
      cliff by the fairest girl of the tribe. It was counted an honor not only
      by the tribe to whose lot it fell to make the costly sacrifice, but even
      by the doomed maiden herself. The only daughter of a widowed Chief of the
      Seneca Indians was chosen as a sacrificial offering to the Spirit of
      Niagara. Tolonga, the Great Elk, was bravest among the warriors, and
      devotedly attached to his child, but, when the lot fell on her, he
      crushed down in the pride of Indian endurance the feelings of grief that
      filled his bosom. The eventful night arrived. The moon arose and shone
      brightly down oh the turmoil of Niagara, when the White Canoe and its
      precious freight glided from the bank and swept out into the dread rapid.
      The young girl calmly steered towards the centre of the stream, when
      suddenly another canoe shot forth upon the water and, under the strong
      impulse of the Seneca Chief, flew like an arrow to destruction. It
      overtook the first; the eyes of father and child met in a parting gaze of
      love, and then they plunged together over the Cataract into Eternity.

      Oh weary heart! I have wandered lone<br>
       Close to Niagara&rsquo;s awful throne;<br>
       I&rsquo;ve gazed till his roar and fearful might<br>
       Have dulled mine ear and blinded my sight;<br>
       I&rsquo;ve heard the hoarse and terrible song<br>

       And plunged down the watery precipice steep,<br>
       Like white-robed furies that whirl and leap.<br>

       Grasped in their stormy, cruel embrace,<br>
       The tender arms that have clasped me oft<br>
       In dying agony flung aloft,<br>
       The delicate limbs a helpless prey<br>
       To their maddened rage, or demon play;<br>
       And I turned aside in anguish wild.<br>
       Oh, wretched Father! My child, my child!<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;In its gorgeous autumn dyes,<br>
       Its tints as bright and as fair to the sight<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;As the hues of our sunset skies;<br>
       And the sun&rsquo;s glad rays veiled by golden haze,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Streamed down &rsquo;neath its arches grand,<br>
       And with magic power made scene and hour<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Like a dream of Faerie Land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emerald sheen of the maple green<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Is turned to deep, rich red;<br>
       And the boughs entwine with the crimson vine<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That is climbing overhead;<br>
       While, like golden sheaves, the saffron leaves<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sycamore strew the ground,<br>
       &rsquo;Neath birches old, clad in shimmering gold,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Or the ash with red berries crowned.

    <p>
      Stately and tall, o&rsquo;er its sisters all,<br>

    <p>
      When wearied the gaze with the vivid blaze<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of rich tints before it spread&mdash;<br>
       Gay orange and gold, with shades untold<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of glowing carmine and red&mdash;<br>
       It can turn &rsquo;mid the scene to the sombre green<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Mid the season&rsquo;s swift decline.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;No longer charms the ear,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;And the days of winter&rsquo;s gloom,<br>
       The heart must yield to the power they wield,&mdash;<br>

       A hundred years and more hast thou<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy shadow o&rsquo;er us cast;<br>
       And we claim thee in our country&rsquo;s youth<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;As a land-mark of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou&rsquo;st seen the glittering Fleur-de-lys<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Fling out its folds on high<br>
       From old Dalhousie&rsquo;s* fortress hill,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Against the morning sky;<br>
       And, later, the gleam of an English flag<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;From its cannon-crowned brow,&mdash;<br>
       That flag which, despite the changing years,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Floateth proudly o&rsquo;er us now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou&rsquo;st seen the dark-browed Indians, too,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Thronging each narrow street,<br>
       In their garb so strangely picturesque,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Their gaily moccassined feet;<br>
       And beside them gentle helpmates stood,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Dark-hued, with soft black eyes,<br>
       In blanket robes, with necklets bright&mdash;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Large beads of brilliant dyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou&rsquo;st seen our city far outgrow<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;The bounds of its ancient walls,<br>
       In beauty growing and in wealth,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And free from early thralls,<br>
       Till round Mount Royal&rsquo;s queenly heights,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That stretch toward the sky,<br>
       In pomp and splendor, beauteous homes<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of luxury closely lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within this time-worn portal prayed<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;The sons of differing creeds,<br>
       And unto God, in various ways,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Made known their various needs.<br>
       Better dwell thus in brotherly love,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;All seeking one common weal,<br>
       Than stir the stormy waters of strife<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Through hasty and misjudged zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for many years the exiles lone,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Who landed upon our shore<br>
       From Erin&rsquo;s green and sunny isle,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Did here their God adore;<br>
       And laid their aching sad hearts bare<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;To His kind, pitying gaze,<br>
       And prayed to Him in this new strange land<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;For better and brighter days.
    </p>
    <p>
      And humble Recollect Friars here<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Their matins recited o&rsquo;er,<br>
       And glided with noiseless, sandalled feet<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er the chapel&rsquo;s sacred floor;<br>
       Again, at the close of day they met,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Amid clouds of incense dim<br>
       And the softened, rays of tapers&rsquo; blaze,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;To sing their evening hymn.
    </p>
    <p>
      They and their order have passed away<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;From among their fellow-men.<br>
       Little recked they for earth&rsquo;s joys or gains,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;On heaven bent their ken.<br>
       The lowly church that has borne their name<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;So faithfully to the last,<br>
       Linked with our city&rsquo;s young days, like them,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Will henceforth be of the past.

      <a name="sacred43">WINTER IN CANADA.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nay tell me not that, with shivering fear,<br>
       You shrink from the thought of wintering here;<br>
       That the cold intense of our winter-time<br>
       Is severe as that of Siberian clime,<br>
       And, if wishes could waft you across the sea,<br>
       You, to-night, in your English home would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, no hedges there now are bright<br>
       With verdure, or blossoms of hawthorn white;<br>
       In damp, sodden fields or bare garden beds<br>
       No daisies or cowslips show their heads;<br>
       Whilst chill winds and skies of gloomy hue<br>
       Tell in England, as elsewhere, &rsquo;tis winter too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away with dull thoughts! Raise your brooding eyes<br>
       To yonder unclouded azure skies;<br>
       Look round on the earth, robed in bridal white,<br>
       All glittering and flashing with diamonds bright,<br>
       While o&rsquo;er head, her lover and lord, the sun,<br>
       Shines brightly as e&rsquo;er in summer he&rsquo;s done.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a graceful sleigh, drawn by spirited steed,<br>
       You glide o&rsquo;er the snow with lightning speed,<br>
       Whilst from harness, decked with silvery bells,<br>
       sweet showers the sound on the clear air swells;<br>
       And the keen bracing breeze, with vigor rife,<br>
       Sends quick through your veins warm streams of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, on with your snow-shoes, so strong and light,<br>
       Thick blanket-coat, sash of scarlet bright,<br>
       And, away o&rsquo;er the deep and untrodden snow,<br>
       Through wood, o&rsquo;er mountain, untrammelled to go<br>
       Through lone, narrow paths, where in years long fled,<br>
       The Indian passed with light active tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      What! dare to rail at our snow-storms, why<br>
       Not view them with poet&rsquo;s or artist&rsquo;s eye?<br>
       Watch each pearly flake as it falls from above,<br>
       Like snowy plumes from some spotless dove,<br>
       Clothing all objects in ermine rare,<br>
       More sure than the bright robes which monarchs wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you not witnessed our glorious nights,<br>
       So brilliant with gleaming Northern lights,<br>
       Quick flashing and darting across the sky<br>
       While far in the starry heavens on high<br>
       The shining moon pours streams of light<br>
       O&rsquo;er the silent earth, robed in dazzling white.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are times, too, our woods show wond&rsquo;rous sights<br>
       Such as are read of in &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo;<br>
       When branch and bough are all laden with gems<br>
       Bright as those that deck Eastern diadems;<br>
       And the sun sheds a blaze of dazzling light<br>
       On ruby and opal and diamond bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only tarry till Spring on Canadian shore,<br>
       And you&rsquo;ll rail at our Tenters, then, no more;<br>
       New health and fresh life through your veins shall glow,<br>
       Spite of piercing winds&mdash;spite of ice and snow,<br>
       And I&rsquo;d venture to promise, in truth, my friend,<br>

       And wore a smiling lip and brow<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;On the pyre their foes had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      And e&rsquo;en in Winter fair art thou,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;With many a brilliant gem,<br>
       That might adorn fair lady&rsquo;s brow,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Or deck a diadem;<br>
       And better than thy beauty rare,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Or shade thou givest free,<br>
       The life-stream of thy branches fair<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Thou gen&rsquo;rous, brave old tree!
    </p>
    <p>
      Warmly we pray no deed of harm<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;May fright thy peaceful shade,<br>
       May&rsquo;st thou ne&rsquo;er see in war&rsquo;s alarm<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Contending foes arrayed,<br>
       But, smiling down on peasants brave,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;On honest tranquil toil,<br>
       Thy branches ever brightly wave,<br>

       Drooping and faint&mdash;the flowrets fair,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;While breathing this hot, scorching air,<br>
       It wearies me to raise the flowers,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;d much prefer to stay at home.<br>
       Themselves upon the ground they throw,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Cheeks pillowed on each rounded arm&mdash;<br>

    <p>
      On proud Mount Royal&rsquo;s Eastern side,<br>
       In view of St. Lawrence&rsquo;s silver tide,<br>
       Are two stone towers of masonry rude,<br>
       With massive doors of time-darken&rsquo;d wood:<br>
       Traces of loop-holes are in the walls,<br>
       While softly across them the sun-light falls;<br>
       Around broad meadows, quiet and green,<br>
       With grazing cattle&mdash;a pastoral scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those towers tell of a time long past,<br>
       When the red man roamed o&rsquo;er regions vast,<br>
       And the settlers&mdash;men of bold heart and brow&mdash;<br>
       Had to use the sword as well as the plough;<br>
       When women (no lovelier now than then)<br>
       Had to do the deeds of undaunted men,<br>
       And when higher aims engrossed the heart<br>
       Than study of fashions or toilet&rsquo;s art.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hardy race from beyond the sea<br>
       Were those ancient founders of Ville Marie!<br>
       The treacherous Sioux and Iroquois bold<br>
       Gathered round them as wolves that beset a fold,<br>
       Yet they sought their rest free from coward fears;<br>
       Though war-whoops often reached their ears,<br>
       Or battle&rsquo;s red light their slumbers dispel,&mdash;<br>
       They knew God could guard and protect them well.

       Rougemont, St. Hilary, Boucherville,<br>
       Kissing the fairy-like isle of St Paul&rsquo;s,<br>
       Where, hushed and holy, the twilight falls,<br>
       Or St. Helen&rsquo;s, amid the green wave&rsquo;s spray,<br>
       All lovely and calm as it is today.

    <p>
      No villas with porticos handsome, wide,<br>
       Then dotted our queenly mountain&rsquo;s side;<br>
       No busy and populous city nigh<br>
       Raised steeples and domes to the clear blue sky;<br>
       Uncleared, unsettled our forests hoar<br>
       Unbridged out river, unwharfed each shore;<br>
       While over the waves of emerald hue<br>
       Glided, lightly, the Indian&rsquo;s bark canoe.

      It was in those towers&mdash;the Southern one&mdash;<br>
       Sister Margaret Bourgeoys, that sainted nun,<br>

       How to find to Jesus the blessed way,<br>
       &rsquo;Mid the daughters swarth of the forest dell,<br>
       Who first from her lips of a God heard tell,<br>
       And learned the virtues that woman should grace,<br>
       Whatever might be her rank or race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, too, in the chapel-tower buried deep,<br>
       An Indian <i>brave</i> and his grand-child sleep.*<br>
       True model of womanly virtues&mdash;she&mdash;<br>
       Acquired at Margaret Bourgeoys&rsquo; knee;<br>
       He, won to Christ from his own dark creed,<br>
       From the trammels fierce of his childhood freed,<br>
       Lowly humbled his savage Huron pride,<br>
       And amid the pale-faces lived and died.

      With each added year grows our city fair,<br>
       The steepled church, and spacious square,<br>
       Villas and mansions of stately pride<br>
       Embellish it now on every side;<br>
       Buildings&mdash;old land marks&mdash;vanish each day,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of our mountain&rsquo;s regal height,<br>
       And gazed on the scene before him,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;By October&rsquo;s golden light,<br>
       And his dark eyes, earnest, thoughtful,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Lit up with a softer ray<br>
       As they dwelt on the scene of beauty<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That, outspread, before him lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a sea of liquid silver,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;St. Lawrence, &rsquo;neath the sun,<br>
       Reflected the forest foliage<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And the Indian wigwams dun,<br>
       Embracing the fairy islands<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That its swift tide loving laves,<br>
       Reposing in tranquil beauty<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Amid its sapphire waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the eastward, frowning mountains<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Rose in solemn grandeur still,<br>
       The glittering sunlight glinting<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;On steep and rugged hill;<br>
       Whilst in the far horizon,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Past leafy dell and haunt,<br>
       Like a line of misty purple,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the dim hills of Vermont.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Cartier&rsquo;s rapt gaze wandered<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Where, starred with wild flowers sweet,<br>
       In its gorgeous autumn beauty,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the forest at his feet.<br>
       With red and golden glory<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;All the foliage seemed ablaze<br>
       Yet with brightness strangely softened<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;By October&rsquo;s amber haze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around him stretched the mountain<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Ever lovely&mdash;ever young&mdash;<br>
       Graceful, softly undulating,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;By tall forest trees o&rsquo;erhung;<br>
       &rsquo;Twas then his thought found utterance,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;The words &ldquo;<i>Mont Royal</i>&rdquo; came,<br>
       And thus our Royal Mountain<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Received its fitting name.

       Now, tell me, dost thou not think it bliss<br>
       To dwell in a home as bright as this?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      <a name="sacred36">THE TRYST OF THE SACHEM&rsquo;S DAUGHTER.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the far green depths of the forest glade,<br>
       Where the hunter&rsquo;s footsteps but rarely strayed,<br>
       Was a darksome dell, possessed, &rsquo;twas said,<br>
       By an evil spirit, dark and dread,<br>
       Whose weird voice spoke in the whisperings low<br>
       Of that haunted wood, and the torrent&rsquo;s flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>There</i> an Indian girl sat silent, lone,<br>
       From her lips came no plaint or stifled moan,<br>
       But the seal of anguish, hopeless and wild,<br>
       Was stamped on the brow of the forest child,<br>
       And her breast was laden with anxious fears,<br>
       And her dark eyes heavy with unshed tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! a few months since, when the soft spring gales<br>
       With fragrance were filling the forest dales;<br>
       When sunshine had chased stern winter&rsquo;s gloom,<br>
       And woods had awoke in their new-born bloom,<br>
       No step had been lighter on upland or hill<br>
       Than her&rsquo;s who sat there so weary and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the silken ears of the tasseled maize<br>
       Had ripened beneath the sun&rsquo;s fierce blaze,<br>
       And the summer&rsquo;s sunshine, warm and bright,<br>
       Had been followed by autumn&rsquo;s amber light,<br>
       While the trees robed in glowing gold and red,<br>
       Their fast falling leaves thickly round her shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Sachem&rsquo;s daughter, beloved and revered,<br>
       To the honest hearts of her tribe endeared<br>
       By her goodness rare and her lovely face,<br>
       Her innocent mirth and her artless grace;<br>
       Wooed oft by young Indian braves as their bride,<br>
       Sought by stern-browed chiefs for their wigwam&rsquo;s pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heart-free, unwon, she had turned from each prayer,<br>
       And thought but of smoothing her raven hair;<br>
       Of embroidering moccasins, dainty, neat,<br>
       With quills and gay beads for her tiny feet;<br>
       Or skilfully guiding her bark canoe<br>
       O&rsquo;er St. Lawrence&rsquo;s waves of sparkling blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas for the hour, when in woodlands wild<br>
       The white man met with the Sachem&rsquo;s child,<br>
       And she wondering gazed on his golden hair,<br>
       His deep blue eyes, and his forehead fair,<br>
       And his rich soft voice fell low on her ear,<br>
       And became to her heart, alas! too dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well trained was he in each courtly art<br>
       That can please and win a woman&rsquo;s heart;<br>
       And many a girl of lineage high<br>
       Had looked on his wooing with fav&rsquo;ring eye:<br>
       Inconstant to all, in hall or in bower,<br>
       What chance of escape had this forest flower?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, ah! very soon, he tired of her smile,<br>
       Her dusky charms and each sweet, shy wile;<br>
       And yet it was long ere, poor trusting dove,<br>
       Her faith was shaken in the white man&rsquo;s love;<br>
       And now one last tryst she had asked of him<br>
       In this haunted glade in the forest dim.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had lightly vowed, as such men will do,<br>
       To the place and hour that he would be true;<br>
       She had waited since the dawn broke chill,<br>
       Till the sun was setting behind the hill;<br>
       But for him, amid scenes of fashion gay,<br>
       All thought of his promise had passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait for him here,&rdquo; she softly said,<br>
       &ldquo;Yes, wait till he comes,&rdquo; and her weary head<br>
       Drooped low on her breast, and when the night,<br>
       On noiseless pinions had taken its flight,<br>
       She looked at the sunrise, with eyes grown dim,<br>
       And murmured: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait here for death or him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was death that came, and with kindly touch<br>
       He stilled the heart that had borne so much;<br>
       To the <i>Manitou</i> praying, she passed away<br>
       With the sunset clouds of another day,&mdash;<br>
       No anger quickened her failing breath,<br>
       Patient, unmurmuring, even in death.
    </p>
    <p>
      For days they sought her, the sons of her race,<br>
       In deep far-off woods, in each secret place,<br>
       Till at length to the haunted glade they crept,<br>
       And found her there as in death she slept.<br>
       They whispered low of the spirit of ill,<br>
       And buried her quickly beside the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      That year her false lover back with him bore<br>
       A radiant bride to his native shore.<br>
       And, with smiling triumph and joy elate,<br>
       Ne&rsquo;er gave one thought to his dark love&rsquo;s fate;<br>
       But an All-seeing Judge, in wrath arrayed,<br>
       Shall avenge the wrongs of that Indian maid.

      &ldquo;Oh, Earth, where is the mantle of pleasant emerald dye<br>
       That robed thee in sweet summer-time, and gladdened heart and eye,<br>
       Adorned with blooming roses, graceful ferns and blossoms sweet,<br>
       And bright green moss like velvet that lay soft beneath our feet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! am I not as lovely in my garb of spotless white?<br>
       Was young bride in her beauty ever clothed in robe as bright?<br>
       Or, if you seek for tinting warm, at morn and evening hour,<br>
       You&rsquo;ll find me bathed in blushes bright as those of summer
      flower.&rdquo;

       The golden sunbeams peering &rsquo;mid the green leaves here and
      there,<br>
       And I sigh to see the branches so cheerless and so bare.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;But oft they&rsquo;re clothed in ermine to the sight and touch

       Whilst at times the glitt&rsquo;ring branches with jewels are

       As light barks glided swiftly o&rsquo;er their azure waves at will,<br>
       Held now in icy barriers that guard them cold and still.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;But, see their glassy bosom, what scene could be more bright?<br>
       How gaily o&rsquo;er the surface darts the skater, strong and light;<br>

       And forms are clearly mirrored on that dazzling crystal floor.&rdquo;

       Driving the snow and sharp blinding sleet<br>
       In gusty whirls through square and street,<br>
       Shrieking more wildly and fiercely still<br>
       In the dreary grave-yard that crowns the hill.

      No mourners there to sorrow or pray,<br>

       Thronged on his thoughts in that moment lone.<br>
       &ldquo;Yes, happiness-hope,&rdquo; he murmured low,<br>

      <a name="sacred18">MONUMENT TO IRISH EMIGRANTS.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      It will be in the recollection of many of our readers that during the
      famine years of 1847 and 1848 there was an unusual emigration from
      Ireland to Canada and the United States. Numbers of those who thus left
      their native land expired from ship fever, caused by utter exhaustion,
      before they reached the American continent; others only arrived there to
      die of that fatal disease. The Canadian Government made extensive efforts
      to save the lives of the poor emigrants. A large proportion were spared,
      but at Montreal, where the Government erected temporary hospitals, on an
      immense scale, upwards of 6000 of these poor people died. Their remains
      were interred close to the hospitals, at a place that is now mainly
      covered with railway buildings, and in close proximity to the point
      whence the Victoria Bridge projects into the St. Lawrence. All traces of
      the sad events of that disastrous period would have been obliterated but
      for the warm and reverential impulses of Mr. James Hodges, the engineer
      and representative of Messrs. Peto, Brassey &amp; Betts in Canada.
      Through his instrumentality, and by his encouragement, the workmen at the
      bridge came to the determination of erecting a monument on the spot where
      the poor Irish emigrants were interred. An enormous granite boulder, of a
      rough conical shape, weighing 30 tons, was dug up in the vicinity, and
      was placed on a base of cut stone masonry, twelve feet square by six feet
      high. The stone bears the following inscription: &ldquo;To preserve from
      desecration the remains of 6000 emigrants who died from ship fever in
      1847 and 1848 this monument is erected by workmen in the employment of
      Messrs. Peto, Brassey, &amp; Betts, engaged in the construction of the
      Victoria Bridge, 1859.&rdquo; Several addresses were delivered on the
      occasion, and in the course of that made by the Bishop of Montreal he
      alluded in feeling terms to the many good deeds for which the Dame of his
      friend, Mr. James Hodges, will be gratefully remembered in Canada. Thanks
      to the latter, the plot of ground on which the monument is raised is set
      apart for ever, so that the remains of those interred there will
      henceforth be sacred from any irreverent treatment.

    <p>
      The dusky warriors stood in groups around the funeral pyre,<br>
       The scowl upon their knotted brows betrayed their vengeful ire.<br>
       It needed not the cords, the stake, the rites so stern and rude,<br>
       To tell it was to be a scene of cruelty and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet &rsquo;mid those guilt-stained men could any vile enough be found<br>
       To harm the victim who there stood, in helpless thraldom bound?<br>
       A girl of slight and fragile form, of gentle child-like grace,<br>
       Though woman&rsquo;s earnest thoughtfulness beamed in that sweet young
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! lovely was that winsome child of a dark and rugged line,<br>
       And e&rsquo;en mid Europe&rsquo;s daughters fair, surpassing might she
      shine:<br>
       For ne&rsquo;er had coral lips been wreathed by brighter, sunnier
      smile,<br>
       Or dark eyes beamed with lustrous light, more full of winsome wile.
    </p>
    <p>
      With glowing cheek and curving lip, she stood, in silent pride,<br>
       A queen in simple majesty, though captive bound and tied,<br>
       Nor could that sight of death, though fit to turn a strong heart
      weak,<br>
       Chase back the deep scorn from her brow, the color from her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, yet, it was not wonderful, that haughty, high-born grace,<br>
       She stood amid her direst foes, a Princess of her race;<br>
       Knowing they&rsquo;d met to wreak on her their hatred &rsquo;gainst her
      name,<br>
       To doom her to a fearful death, to pangs of fire and flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, mindful of the teachings stern of childhood&rsquo;s early years,<br>
       She had firmly vowed no plaints of hers, or womanish weak tears<br>
       Would glad her foes but, as became her rank and lineage high,<br>
       That she would, like a Huron maid, nobly and bravely die.
    </p>
    <p>
      One moment,&mdash;then her proud glance fled, her form she humbly
      bowed,<br>
       A softened light stole o&rsquo;er her brow, she prayed to heaven
      aloud:<br>
       &ldquo;Hear me, Thou Great and Glorious One, Protector of my race,<br>
       Whom, in the far-off Spirit land, I&rsquo;ll soon see face to face!

       Above the guileful Iroquois&mdash;Thine and our enemies;<br>
       And give me strength to bear each pang with courage high and free,<br>
       That, dying thus, I may be fit to reign, oh God! with Thee.&ldquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her prayer was ended, and again, like crowned and sceptred Queen,<br>
       She wore anew her lofty smile, her high and royal mien,<br>
       E&rsquo;en though the Chief the signal gave, and quick two warriors
      dire,<br>
       Sprang forth to lead the dauntless girl to the lit funeral pyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back, with an eye of flashing scorn, recoiled she from their grasp,<br>
       &rdquo;Nay, touch me not, I&rsquo;d rather meet the coil of poisoned
      asp!<br>
       My aged sire, and all my tribe will learn with honest pride<br>

      She dashed aside her tresses dark with bright and fearless smile,<br>
       And like a fawn she bounded on the fearful funeral pile;<br>

       They praised that maiden&rsquo;s courage rare, her high and dauntless

       In the humble convent chapel<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Nuns of Notre Dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl of fifteen summers,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;With gentle, serious air,<br>
       In novice garb of purple,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Was humbly kneeling there;<br>
       Uttering the vows so binding<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Whose magic power sufficed<br>
       To make that child-like maiden<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;The well-loved Bride of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      No troubled, anxious shadow<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er-clouded that young brow,<br>
       As with look and voice unfaltering<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;She breathed her solemn vow:<br>
       No regretful glances cast she<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;On the pomps that she had spurned,<br>
       Nor the dream of love and pleasure<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;From which she had coldly turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty years of joy and sorrow<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Since that day have o&rsquo;er her flown&mdash;<br>
       Years of words and deeds of mercy,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Living but for God alone&mdash;<br>
       And again a group is standing,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;By this holy scene enticed,<br>
       To renew the golden bridal<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of this faithful spouse of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, her brow has lost the smoothness<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And her cheek the fresh young glow<br>
       That adorned them on that autumn<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Morning&mdash;fifty years ago;<br>
       But, oh! think not that her Bridegroom<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Loves her anything the less;<br>
       He sees but the inward beauty<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And the spirit&rsquo;s loveliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cloister honors long have fallen<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Ceaseless, constant, to her lot,<br>
       But, like cloister honors falling,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Unto one who sought them not;<br>
       Daughter meek of the great Foundress<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy honored house and name,<br>
       Worthy art thou to be Abbess<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of the nuns of Notre Dame!

    <h3>
      In Memoriam.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Grief reigns now within the convent walls,<br>
       And sadly float through its silent halls<br>
       The notes of a requiem&mdash;solemn, clear,<br>
       Falling like wail on each listening ear,<br>
       And with tearful eyes and features pale,<br>
       With low bowed head and close drawn veil,<br>
       To the convent church, round a bier to kneel,<br>
       The daughters of Marguerite Bourgeoys steal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scant is the mourning pomp displayed,<br>
       Nor plumes nor hangings of gloomy shade,<br>
       But rev&rsquo;rend prelates and priests are there,<br>
       With crowds of mourners joining in prayer;<br>
       Each sister&rsquo;s heart is filled with grief,<br>
       To which faith alone can bring relief,<br>
       Deploring the loss of that sainted nun,<br>
       Friend, mother and abbess, all in one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet why should sorrow fill thus each breast?<br>
       That well loved one has entered her rest,<br>
       To live in eternal, cloudless light,<br>
       To live in our memories, blessed and bright;<br>
       Her chair may be vacant&mdash;her place unfilled&mdash;<br>
       But her mission high was all fulfilled.<br>
       And the thought of how well she did her part<br>
       Will ever dwell in each sister&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixty-one years passed in convent home,<br>
       Amassing wealth for a world to come,<br>
       Sixty-one years of constant prayer,<br>
       Of cloister duties fulfilled with care,<br>
       Of gentle aid to each sister dear,<br>
       Kind tender counsel&mdash;sympathy&rsquo;s tear,<br>
       Of high commune with her Maker, known<br>
       Perchance to herself and to God alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixty-one years, oh! think of it well,<br>
       Since first she entered the convent cell!<br>
       On her cheek youth&rsquo;s soft and roseate dyes,<br>
       Its radiant light in her cloudless eyes,<br>
       Turning from earth&rsquo;s alluring wiles,<br>
       From worldly promptings, from pleasure&rsquo;s smiles,<br>
       From love&rsquo;s soft pleading look and tone,<br>
       To give herself unto God alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then she has witnessed many a change,<br>
       In the world around her, startling, strange;<br>
       Her much loved Order growing in strength<br>
       Throughout America&rsquo;s breadth and length;<br>
       Our young city stretching far and wide,<br>
       Till it reaches Mount Royal&rsquo;s verdant side,<br>
       Where, fair as an Eden, through leafy screen,<br>
       Villa Maria is dimly seen.

    <p>
      Timeworn foreheads and brows of snow<br>
       Has the one we mourn seen in dust laid low;<br>
       Fair girlish novice and nun professed,<br>
       Quietly gathered to earth&rsquo;s dark breast;<br>
       But with thoughts on heaven, she, through all,<br>
       Patiently waited her Father&rsquo;s call,<br>
       It came, and now she lays gladly down<br>

    </h2>
    <h3>
      A TALE OF EARLY COLORADO.
    </h3>
    <p>
      My simple story is of those times ere the magic power of steam<br>
       First whirled the traveller o&rsquo;er the plains with the swiftness of
      a dream,<br>
       Reducing to a few days&rsquo; time the journey of many a week,<br>
       That fell of old to the miner&rsquo;s lot ere he &rdquo;sighted&ldquo;
      tall Pikes Peak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &rsquo;Neath liquid sunshine filling the air, &rsquo;mid masses of wild
      flowers gay,<br>
       A prairie waggon followed the track that led o&rsquo;er the plains
      away;<br>
       And most of those &rsquo;neath its canvas roof were of lawless type and
      rude&mdash;<br>
       Miners, broad-chested and strongly built, a reckless, gold-seeking
      brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet two of the number surely seemed most strangely out of place,<br>
       A girl with fragile, graceful form, shy look, and beauteous face,<br>
       One who had wrought out the old, old tale, left her home and friends for
      aye,<br>
       Braved family frowns and strangers&rsquo; smiles, love&rsquo;s
      promptings to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the lover husband at her side no miner rough was he,<br>
       If we may believe the shapely hands as a woman&rsquo;s fair to see;<br>
       But his tall, lithe form, so strongly knit, firm mouth and look of
      pride,<br>
       Told of iron will, resolved to win a home for his darling bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tender he was, but the plains were vast, toilsome and tedious the
      way,<br>
       Developing soon the fever germs that within her latent lay,<br>
       And daily the velvet azure eyes with a brighter lustre burned,<br>
       And the hectic flush of the waxen cheek to a deeper carmine turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! dread was the time &rsquo;neath that canvas close when she bravely
      fought for breath,<br>
       Fire in her veins, while panting came each laboring painful breath!<br>
       At length one eve she clasped his neck, with a wild and wailing cry:<br>
       &rdquo;O, darling, lay me on God&rsquo;s green earth, &rsquo;neath his
      sun bright clouds to die!&ldquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutely the bridegroom caught her up after that touching appeal;<br>
       Why refuse her prayer when on her brow was already set death&rsquo;s
      seal?<br>
       To proffered help and rough words of hope, to protests whispered
      low,<br>
       He murmured, &rdquo;Leave us, go on your way! Comrades it must be
      so.&ldquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in the eyes of those reckless men bright tears were glistening
      seen,<br>
       For in their rugged, though willing, way most kindly had they been;<br>
       No selfish fears of sickness dire had they shown by look or word,<br>
       For whate&rsquo;er of good dwelt within each heart that helpless girl
      had stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      They raised a tent, and from their stores they brought the very best,<br>
       Whisp&rsquo;ring of speedy help to come as each clammy hand they
      pressed.<br>
       &rdquo;Nay, friends,&ldquo; he said with a short, sharp laugh, more
      painful than sob to hear,<br>
       &rdquo;No help send back, for myself and wife must perforce both settle
      here.&ldquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat him down, and placed her head on his aching, throbbing
      breast,<br>
       While the sweeping rush of the prairie winds seemed to bring relief and
      rest,<br>
       And her dim eye watched, without a shade of regret or passing pain,<br>
       The receding waggon, soon a speck on the wide and boundless plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &rdquo;O Will! on your true and tender heart, happy and calm I die,<br>
       For I know our lives, though severed here, will be joined again on
      high:<br>
       One kiss, my husband, loving and loved, one clasp of thy strong kind
      hand,<br>
       One farewell look in thy mournful eyes ere I pass to the Spirit Land!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, God! what is this?&rdquo; she wildly asks with hurried,
      panting gasp;<br>
       Her fingers have touched a weapon of death in her husband&rsquo;s hand
      close clasped:<br>
       &ldquo;O, surely, you would not&mdash;dare not&mdash;go uncalled to your
      Maker&rsquo;s sight?&rdquo;<br>
       &ldquo;Wife, when passes your spirit away, mine, too, shall take its
      flight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It boots not to tell of the loving prayers that welled from that true
      wife&rsquo;s heart,<br>
       She sued with an angels holy power, a woman&rsquo;s winning art,<br>
       Till that desp&rsquo;rate man, with quick low sob, his weapon tossed
      away,<br>
       And promised, till came his Maker&rsquo;s call, on this cheerless earth
      to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then sunshine lit up her wan white face and brightened her failing
      eyes,<br>
       Enkindling upon her marble cheek the glow of the sunset skies;<br>
       Closer she nestled unto his breast with a smile of childlike bliss;<br>
       &ldquo;Already a foretaste of yon bright Heaven is given me, Will, in
      this!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while and the lashes drooped, unstirred by life&rsquo;s faint
      breath,<br>
       Whilst the sweet smile on the perfect lips was sealed, for aye, by
      Death.<br>
       With the second sunset he laid her in her lonely prairie grave,<br>
       Then joined a passing miner&rsquo;s band that a friendly welcome gave.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as time sped on, all, wond&rsquo;ring, marked his silent, lonely
      ways,<br>
       And the brooding nature, recking naught for blame, nor mirth, nor
      praise.<br>
       At rudest tasks of the miner&rsquo;s toil with fevered zeal he
      wrought,<br>
       But to its tempting golden spoils he gave nor word nor thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon want and toil and autumn rains brought fever in their train,<br>
       And Red Rock Camp resounded with delirious moans of pain;<br>
       And the healthy shrank from the fevered ones, with hard, unpitying
      eye,<br>
       And, heeding but their selfish fears left the sick, unnursed, to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then unto the stranger in their midst, new hope and vigor came,<br>
       Enkindled swift in that nature grand by charity&rsquo;s ardent
      flame;<br>
       He nursed the sick and buried the dead, by the dying watched, until<br>
       The grateful miners blessed the chance that had brought them
      &ldquo;Parson Will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &rsquo;Twas thus they named him. Health returned to the stricken camp
      again.<br>
       One victim more the fever claimed&mdash;&rsquo;twas he; nor grief nor
      pain<br>
       Could be discerned in those patient eyes, but they shone with a radiant
      light<br>
       As he whispered: &ldquo;Joy and gladness come close after the cold dark
      night;<br>
       A few short hours, and from life&rsquo;s dull chain will my weary heart
      be free,<br>
       Then, Angel Wife, my promise kept, I go to God and thee!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="narrative01">BOUND FOR CALIFORNIA.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      With buoyant heart he left his home for that bright wond&rsquo;rous
      land<br>
       Where gold ore gleams in countless mines, and gold dust strews the
      sand;<br>
       And youth&rsquo;s dear ties were riven all, for as wild, as vain, a
      dream<br>
       As the meteor false that leads astray the traveller with its gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vainly his father frowned dissent, his mother, tearful, prayed,<br>
       Vainly his sisters, with fond words, his purpose would have stayed;<br>
       He heard them all with heedless ear, with dauntless heart and
      bold&mdash;<br>
       Whisp&rsquo;ring to soothe each yearning fear &ldquo;I go to win you
      gold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Restless he paced the deck until he saw the sails unfurled<br>
       Of the ship which was to bear him to that new and distant world;<br>
       And when his comrades stood with him and watched the lessening land,<br>
       His clear laugh rose the loudest &rsquo;mid that gay gold-seekers&rsquo;
      band.
    </p>
    <p>
      In changing moods of grief and mirth the ocean way was passed,<br>
       And all were weary, when the cry of &ldquo;Land&rdquo; was heard at
      last.<br>
       Like birds escaped from thraldom long, the happy, smiling crowd<br>
       Thronged to the deck with eager looks, rejoicing long and loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet one was missing &rsquo;mid that band who foremost should have
      been,<br>
       Whose hopeful heart had cheered them oft when winds blew fierce and
      keen;<br>
       And when dead calms or drizzling rains made the ocean way seem long<br>
       Had wiled the time with lively tale, with jest, or stirring song.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a sudden change had come o&rsquo;er him, his ringing voice was
      hushed,<br>
       The smooth young cheek grew pallid, or, at times, was deeply
      flushed;<br>
       And now he lay in his lonely cot, a prey to sickness drear,<br>
       His frame all filled with racking pain&mdash;his heart with doubt and
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, raise me up,&rdquo; he faintly breathed, &ldquo;that I one
      glance may win<br>
       Of that long looked for promised land I ne&rsquo;er may enter in;<br>
       Till I recall the tender words of friends, well loved of old&mdash;<br>
       The friends I left without a pang, in idle search for gold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Exile&rsquo;s prayer was soon obeyed, and round his fevered brow<br>
       The cool land breeze is playing, but death&rsquo;s damps are on it
      now!<br>
       His spirit passed from earth away as Sol&rsquo;s last dying beams<br>
       Lit up the golden Eldorado of all his boyish dreams.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Upon his sculptured judgment throne the Roman Ruler sate;<br>
       His glittering minions stood around in all their gorgeous state;<br>
       But proud as were the noble names that flashed upon each
      shield&mdash;<br>
       Names known in lofty council halls as well as tented field&mdash;<br>
       None dared approach to break the spell of deep and silent gloom<br>
       That hover&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er his haughty brow, like shadow of the tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      While still he mused the air was rent with loud and deaf&rsquo;ning
      cry,<br>
       And angry frown and darker smile proclaimed the victim nigh.<br>
       No traitor to his native land, no outlaw fierce was there,<br>
       &rsquo;Twas but a young and gentle girl, as opening rose bud fair,<br>
       Who stood alone among those men, so dark and full of guile,<br>
       And yet her cheek lost not its bloom, her lips their gentle smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he spoke, that ruthless chief, in tones both stern and
      dread:<br>
       &ldquo;Girl! listen! mark me well, or else thy blood be on thy head!<br>
       Thou art accused of worshipping Jesus the Nazarene&mdash;<br>
       Of scorning Rome&rsquo;s high, mighty Gods,&mdash;speak, say if this has
      been?<br>
       I fain would spare thee, for thy name among our own ranks high;<br>
       Thine age, thy sex, my pity move, I would not see thee die!
    </p>
    <p>
      &rdquo;If thou hast dared at foreign shrine to rashly bend the knee,<br>
       Recant thine errors, and thy guilt cancelled at once shall
      be.&ldquo;<br>
       Undaunted spoke she, &rdquo;In His steps unworthy have I trod,<br>
       And spurned the idols vain of Rome for Him, the Christian&rsquo;s
      God.<br>
       I fear not death, however dread the ghastly shape he wear,<br>
       He whom I serve will give me strength thy torments all to bear.&ldquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Darker than e&rsquo;en the darkest cloud became her judge&rsquo;s
      brow,<br>
       And stern the threats he thundered forth. &rdquo;What dost thou dare
      avow?<br>

      die!&ldquo;<br>
       Unmoved she met his angry frown&mdash;his fierce and flashing eye:<br>
       &rdquo;Nay, I have spoken&mdash;hasten now, fulfil thy direful task,<br>
       The martyr&rsquo;s bright and glorious crown is the sole boon I
      ask.&ldquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fierce was the struggle raging then within her judge&rsquo;s breast,<br>
       For she, that girl, in tones of love, he once had low addressed;<br>
       And lowly as his haughty heart at earthly shrine might bow<br>
       He&rsquo;d loved the being, young and bright, who stood before him
      now.<br>
       With iron might he&rsquo;d nerved himself to say the words of fate,<br>
       To doom to death the girl he sought&mdash;but sought in vain&mdash;to
      hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet now, e&rsquo;en in the final hour, &rsquo;spite of his creed of
      crime,<br>
       His ruthless heart and fierce belief, love triumphed for a time.<br>
       &rdquo;Irene! girl!&ldquo; he wildly prayed, &rdquo;brave not
      Rome&rsquo;s fearful power!<br>
       Mad as thou art, she&rsquo;ll pardon thee, e&rsquo;en in the eleventh
      hour;<br>
       Cast but one grain of incense on yon bright and sacred fire,<br>
       And outraged as thy rulers are, &rsquo;twill calm their lawful
      ire!&ldquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &rdquo;Bend but thy knee before the shrine where we&rsquo;ve so often
      knelt,<br>
       Joined in the same pure orisons&mdash;the same emotion felt;<br>
       Forsake a creed whose very God with scorn was crucified&mdash;,<br>
       Irene, hear me, and thou It be again my life and pride!&ldquo;<br>
       He pressed the censer in her hand, of which one single throw<br>
       Would have restored her all the state, the bliss, that earth might know;
    </p>
    <p>
      But she, inspired by heavenly grace, the censer dashed aside:<br>
       &rdquo;I&rsquo;ve said I but believe in Him who on Mount Calvary
      died!&ldquo;<br>
       He spoke no word, her cruel judge had hurled his glittering dart;<br>
       Barbed with relentless rage, it found his victim&rsquo;s dauntless
      heart.<br>
       She but had time to breathe a prayer that he might be forgiven,<br>
       And in that breath her spotless soul had passed from earth to heaven.

       No jewels sparkled on her brow, so high, so purely fair,<br>

    <p>
      While some now showed their flashing gems with vain, exulting air,<br>

    </h2>
    <p>
      A glorious pageant filled the church of the proud old city of Rheims,<br>
       One such as poet artists choose to form their loftiest themes:<br>
       There France beheld her proudest sons grouped in a glittering ring,<br>
       To place the crown upon the brow of their now triumphant king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full, rich tones of music swelled out on the perfumed air,<br>
       And chosen warriors, gaily decked, emblazoned banners bear:<br>
       Jewels blazed forth, and silver bright shone armor, shield and
      lance,<br>
       Of princes, peers, and nobles proud, the chivalry of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of these honors high, on lowly bended knee,<br>
       Before the altar homage paid to the God of Victory;<br>
       Whilst Renaud Chartres prayed that Heaven might blessings shower
      down<br>
       On that young head on which he now was chosen to place a crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fair was the scene, but fairer far than pomp of church or state,<br>
       Than starry gems or banners proud, or trappings of the great,<br>
       Was the maiden frail whose prophet glance from heaven seemed to
      shine,<br>
       Who, in her mystic beauty, looked half mortal, half divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her slight form cased in armor stern, the Maid of Orleans stood,<br>
       Her place a prouder one than that of prince of royal blood:<br>
       With homage deep to Heaven above, and prayers to Notre Dame,<br>
       She waived above the monarch&rsquo;s head proud Victory&rsquo;s
      Oriflamme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the clouds of incense rose, encircling in its fold<br>
       That shining form, the kneeling king, the canopy of gold,<br>
       It seemed unto the gazers there a scene of magic birth,<br>
       Such as is rarely granted to the children of this earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sudden a mystic sadness steals o&rsquo;er Joan&rsquo;s features
      bright,<br>
       Robbing her brow, her earnest eyes, of their unearthly light:<br>
       A voice from Him, by whose right arm her victories had been won,<br>
       Had whispered, &rsquo;bove the clank of steel, &ldquo;Thy mission now is
      done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perchance the future, then, was shown to her pure spirit&rsquo;s
      gaze,<br>
       The future with its sufferings, the shame, the scaffold&rsquo;s
      blaze;<br>
       The deaf&rsquo;ning shouts, the surging crowd, the incense, mounting
      high,<br>
       Foreshadowed to her shrinking soul the death she was to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youthful monarch now was crowned, and lowly at his feet<br>
       Did France&rsquo;s saviour bend her form, rendering homage meet.<br>
       No guerdon for past deeds of worth sought that young noble heart,<br>
       She, who might all rewards have claimed, asked only to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! France! of all the stoned names that deck thy history&rsquo;s
      page,<br>
       Thy sainted kings, thy warriors proud, thy statesmen stern and sage,<br>
       None, none received the glorious light, the strange Promethean spark<br>

      Proudly the father gazed upon his bearing brave and high,<br>

       &ldquo;My son, thou art the eldest hope of a proud honored name,<br>
       Then, let thy guiding star through life&mdash;thy chief pursuit&mdash;be
      fame!&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well! thou&rsquo;st chosen, father, well&mdash;it is a
      glorious part!&rdquo;<br>
       And the youth&rsquo;s glance told the wish chimed well with that brave
      ardent heart.<br>
       &ldquo;Now, brother, thou&rsquo;lt have none to share thy sports till I
      return,&mdash;<br>
       Say, what shall be the glitt&rsquo;ring prize that I afar must
      earn?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world,&rdquo; said the laughing boy, &ldquo;on heroes poor
      looks cold,<br>
       If thou art wise as well as brave, return with store of gold.&rdquo;<br>
       &ldquo;Perchance thou&rsquo;rt right!&rdquo; and now he turned to his
      sister young and fair,<br>
       Braiding with skill a glossy tress of his own raven hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis now thy turn, sweet sister mine, breathe thy
      heart&rsquo;s wish to me,<br>
       If I&rsquo;ve the power, &rsquo;twill be fulfilled, ere I return to
      thee.&rdquo;<br>
       The maiden blushed and whispring low, &ldquo;I prize not wealth or
      pride,<br>
       But, brother, to thy future home bring back a gentle bride.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The merry smile her words had raised fled, as with falt&rsquo;ring
      voice,<br>
       He asked of her, the best beloved, &ldquo;Mother, what is <i>thy</i>
      choice?&rdquo;<br>
       &ldquo;My son! my son!&rdquo; she softly said, &ldquo;hear my wish ere
      we part&mdash;<br>
       Return as now thou goest forth, with true and guileless heart!&rdquo;

      The years sped on with rapid flight, and to his home once more<br>
       The soldier came: he walked not with the buoyant step of yore;<br>
       The eagle eye was sunken, dim, the curls of glossy hair<br>
       Fell careless round an aching brow, once free from shade of care.
    </p>
    <p>
      His soiled and shattered crest he laid low at his father&rsquo;s
      feet,<br>
       And sadly said, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis all I have&mdash;is it an
      off&rsquo;ring meet?<br>
       In battle&rsquo;s front I madly fought, till dead on dead were
      heaped,<br>
       Want, weariness and pain I&rsquo;ve borne, and yet no fame I&rsquo;ve
      reaped.

      &ldquo;Brother, thou told&rsquo;st me to return with treasures like a

       This hacked and dinted sword and shield is all the wealth I bring.<br>

       Though folly may have swayed awhile this heart since last we

       Still, mother, at thy feet, I swear, &rsquo;tis true and stainless yet!

    <p>
      &ldquo;No aim has ever ruled it that thou might&rsquo;st not calmly

       Nor hope nor thought, dear mother, that I&rsquo;d shrink to bare to

       &ldquo;Bless thee, mine own one, for those words! thrice dearer art thou

      &ldquo;And dearer is thy still fond smile, tho&rsquo; dimmed its
      brightness be,<br>
       Than that of fairest bride to glad our home with witching
      glee!&rdquo;<br>
       With all a mother&rsquo;s yearning love, she strained him to her

      Thou&rsquo;rt dying now, my faithful one,<br>

       Thy neck would arch beneath my touch,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Thou&rsquo;dst brighten at my tone;<br>
       But turn not thus thy restless eyes<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my saddened brow,<br>
       Nor look with such imploring gaze&mdash;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot help thee now.
    </p>

      No more we&rsquo;ll bound o&rsquo;er dew gemmed sward<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;At break of summer morn,<br>
       Or follow on, through forests green,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter&rsquo;s merry horn;<br>
       No more we&rsquo;ll brave the rapid stream,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor battle with the tide,<br>
       Nor cross the slipp&rsquo;ry mountain path,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;As we were wont to ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! we have travelled many miles,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And dangers have we braved;<br>
       And more than once thy matchless speed<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy master&rsquo;s life hath saved;<br>
       And many nights the forest sward<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Has been the couch we&rsquo;ve pressed,<br>
       Where, pillowed on thy glossy neck,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Most sweet has been my rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      How often, too, I we shared with thee<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter&rsquo;s scanty fare.<br>
       To see thee suffer want or pain,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Mute friend I could not bear;<br>
       And now, thou best in agony,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;As if thy heart would burst,<br>
       And I, what can I do for thee,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Save slake thy burning thirst?
    </p>
    <p>
      That parting sob, that failing glance&mdash;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;The pains of death are past!<br>
       Thy glazing eyes still turned on me<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;With love unto the last!<br>
       Well may my tears o&rsquo;er thy cold form,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;My steed, flow fast and free,<br>
       For, oh! I have had many friends,<br>

       There is not a nobler, statelier pile<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Than ivy crowned Rathmore Hall;<br>
       And the giant oaks that shadow the wold,<br>
       Though hollowed by time, are not as old<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;As its Norman turrets tall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us follow that stream of sunset red,<br>
       Crimsoning the portal overhead,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Stealing through curtaining lace,<br>
       Where sits in a spacious and lofty room<br>
       Full of gems of art&mdash;exotics in bloom&mdash;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;The Lady of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Rathmore Hall is with praises named,<br>
       Not less is its queen-like mistress famed<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;For wondrous beauty and grace;<br>
       And as she reclines there, calmly now,<br>
       The sunset flush on her ivory brow,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;We marvel at form and face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wondrously perfect, peerlessly fair,<br>
       Are the mouth and the eyes and luxuriant hair,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;As lily she&rsquo;s graceful and fall;<br>
       Not florid full is that lady fair<br>
       But pale and high-bred, with just the air<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That is suited to Rathmore Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health, youth, and loveliness on her smile,<br>
       Her abode that noble and ancient pile,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;She, surely, must happy be&mdash;<br>
       (With each wish fulfilled that wealth can fulfil,<br>
       For as if by magic is wrought her will)<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;A moment wait&mdash;we shall see!
    </p>
    <p>
      At length she moves and heavily sighs,<br>
       While wearily rest her violet eyes<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;On her jewels richly wrought;<br>
       Shuddering, she turns away her gaze<br>
       From flashing diamond and ruby&rsquo;s blaze,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;As she whispers, &ldquo;Too dearly bought!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, slowly rising, the casement nears,<br>
       And looking abroad through a mist of tears<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Sighs: &ldquo;Yes, I have earned it all:<br>
       Crushed a manly heart that too truly loved,<br>
       False to my. vows and to honor proved,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;To be Lady of Rathmore Hall.

    <p>
      &ldquo;What are now its broad rich acres to me,<br>
       Stretching out as far as my gaze can see?<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;With loathing I turn from the scene;<br>
       My womanhood wasting in wild regret<br>
       O&rsquo;er a past that I would, but cannot, forget;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er a life that might have been!
    </p>

      &ldquo;Oh! for the humble, dear home of my youth,<br>
       Its loving warm hearts, its unsullied truth,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Its freedom from fashion&rsquo;s thrall.<br>
       And the blameless hopes&mdash;the bliss that was mine<br>
       Ere awoke in my heart a wish to shine<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;As Lady of Rathmore Hall!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stops, for, lo! in the chamber still,<br>
       Loud barking of hounds and harsh accents fill<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet and dreamy air;<br>
       Swearing at menials&mdash;with lowering brow,<br>
       Earl Rathmore, entering her presence now,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Turns on her an angry stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shudder runs through her&mdash;what does it tell?<br>
       A look in her eyes that not there should dwell&mdash;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;She hates him&mdash;his wedded wife!<br>
       Surely angels grieve in their bliss above<br>
       To see, where there should be perfect love,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Disunion&mdash;unholy strife.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an oath he mutters &ldquo;Still moping, eh!<br>
       From hour to hour and day to-day;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Not for this from thy lowly state&mdash;<br>
       Enticed by the beauty I&rsquo;m weary of now,<br>
       And smiles that have fled from thy sullen brow&mdash;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;I made thee a Rathmore&rsquo;s mate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With no word from her lips she to him replies,<br>
       But the shadow deepens within her eyes,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And she smiles in cold disdain;<br>
       Yet her snowy eyelids haughty droop,<br>
       And the calm, that disdains to his will to stoop,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Mask an aching heart and brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a muttered curse, in still harsher tone,<br>
       He passes out, and thus leaves her alone<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;In her rich and gilded gloom<br>
       Ah, no wretched wife through the whole broad land<br>
       Is as weary of life as that lady grand<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;As she sits in that splendid room.

    <p>
      If a daughter&rsquo;s soft arms should ever twine,<br>
       Lady Rathmore, round that white neck of thine,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Teach her not to barter all<br>

    <h2>
      <a name="narrative09">THE SHEPHERDESS OF THE ARNO.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &rsquo;Tis no wild and wond&rsquo;rous legend, but a simple pious
      tale<br>
       Of a gentle shepherd maiden, dwelling in Italian vale,<br>
       Near where Arno&rsquo;s glittering waters like the sunbeams flash and
      play<br>
       As they mirror back the vineyards through which they take their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in the rosy dawning of girlhood fair and bright,<br>
       And, like morning&rsquo;s smiles and blushes, was she lovely to the
      sight;<br>
       Soft cheeks like sea-shells tinted and radiant hazel eyes;<br>
       But on changing earthly lover were not lavished smiles or sighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, that gentle heart was swelling with a love unbounded, true,<br>
       Such as worldly breast, earth harden&rsquo;d, passion-wearied, never
      knew;<br>
       And each day she sought the chapel of Our Lady in the dell,<br>
       There to seek an hour&rsquo;s communing with the Friend she loved so
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, too, she brought a garland of wild flowers, fragrant, fair,<br>
       Which she culled whilst onward leading her flock with patient care;<br>
       The diamond dew-drops clinging to every petal sweet,&mdash;<br>
       For the mystic Rose of Heaven was it not a tribute meet?
    </p>
    <p>
      The white statue of the Virgin boasted neither crown nor gem;<br>
       On its head she placed her chaplet instead of diadem,<br>
       Murm&rsquo;ring, &ldquo;O, my gentle Mother, would that it were in my
      power<br>
       To give Thee pearl or diamond instead of simple flower!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But for earth she was too winsome, that fair child of faith and love,<br>
       One of those whom God culls early for His gardens bright
      above;<br>
       And the hand of sickness touched her till she faded day by day,<br>
       And to Our Lady&rsquo;s chapel she came no more to pray.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, in the valley, after journeying many a mile,<br>
       Two pious men in holy garb lay down to rest a while,<br>
       And in sleep to both a vision of most wond&rsquo;rous beauty came,<br>
       Such as only visit souls which burn with heav&rsquo;nly love&rsquo;s
      pure flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid clouds of golden brightness they saw to earth float down<br>
       A band of fair young virgins, wearing each a glittering crown;<br>
       And surpassing them in beauty, as the day outshines the night,<br>
       Was high Heaven&rsquo;s regal Mistress&mdash;Our Lady, fair and bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the pious brothers knew at once that she was on her way<br>
       To see a dying maiden, and her love through life repay;<br>
       And when, from slumber waking, they told their vision true,<br>
       They said: &ldquo;Let us go visit this child of Mary, too!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      High instinct lent by Heaven guided on their feet aright,<br>
       And in silence grave they journeyed till a cottage came in sight;<br>
       &rsquo;Neath its humble porch they entered, with bow&rsquo;d and
      reverent head,<br>
       And found themselves in presence of the peaceful, holy dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! most fair the sight! No maiden with bridal wreath on brow<br>
       Ever looked one half so lovely as the one they gazed on now;<br>
       As a lily, fair and spotless, bright and pure each feature shone,<br>
       Bearing impress of that Heaven to which Mary&rsquo;s child had gone.

      sigh;<br>
       And that gaze, intense and yearning, fixed upon the starlit sky?<br>
       Is she not the child of fortune, fortune&rsquo;s pet and darling
      bright,<br>
       Yes, the beauteous, courted heiress&mdash;heroine of the gala night?
    </p>
    <p>
      From the crowds of ardent lovers, who would beset her way,<br>
       Sickened by their whispered flatt&rsquo;ries, she has coldly turned
      away;<br>
       And, as now the thrilling music falls upon her wearied ear,<br>
       She cannot resist a shudder, caused by mingled hate and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is pleasure, then,&rdquo; she murmurs; <i>this</i> is what
      the world calls bliss,<br>
       Oh! for objects less unworthy, for a holier life than this!<br>
       I am weary of its folly. O, Great Father, grant my boon:<br>
       &ldquo;From its sinful, silken meshes, I pray Thee, free me soon!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Did He answer? Now another year has passed with rapid flight,&mdash;<br>
       O&rsquo;er the crowded, silent city broods the spirit of the night;<br>
       In the sick wards of the convent, fever-stricken, gasping, lies,<br>
       One with death&rsquo;s damps on his brow, and its film o&rsquo;er his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There beside him kneels a <i>Sister</i>, in coarse dusky robe and
      veil,<br>
       And with gentle care she moistens those poor lips so dry and pale;<br>
       Now she whispers hope and courage, now she tells of Heaven
      bright&mdash;<br>
       Thus it is the gentle heiress celebrates her next birth-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a trace of weary languor rests upon that ivory brow,<br>
       No vague sigh of restless yearning e&rsquo;er escapes her bosom now;<br>
       Yet more fair and happy looks she, in that simple garb I ween,<br>
       Than when, robed in lace and jewels, she was called a ballroom&rsquo;s
      queen.

    <h2>
      <a name="narrative17">THE YOUNG GREEK ODALISQUE.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &rsquo;Mid silken cushions, richly wrought, a young Greek girl
      reclined,<br>
       And fairer form the harem&rsquo;s walls had ne&rsquo;er before
      enshrined;<br>
       &rsquo;Mid all the young and lovely ones who round her clustered
      there,<br>
       With glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes, she shone supremely fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &rsquo;Tis true that orbs as dark as hers in melting softness shone,<br>
       And lips whose coral hue might vie in brightness with her own;<br>
       And forms as light as ever might in Moslem&rsquo;s heaven be found,<br>
       So full of beauty&rsquo;s witching grace, were lightly hovering round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, oh, how paled their brilliant charms before that beauteous one<br>
       Who, &rsquo;mid their gay mirth, silent sat, from all
      apart&mdash;alone,<br>
       Outshining all, not by the spells of lovely face or form,<br>
       But by the soul that shone through all, her peerless, priceless charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, say, what were the visions sweet that filled that gentle heart?<br>
       Surely to Azof, her liege lord, was given the greatest part,&mdash;<br>
       To him who prized her smiles beyond the power his sceptre gave,<br>
       And, mighty sultan though he was, to her was as a slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not of crowned heads thought she then, of hall or gilded dome,<br>
       But of fair Greece, that classic land, her loved, her early home.<br>
       She yearns to see again its skies, proud temples, woodland flowers,<br>
       Less bright, but dearer far, than those that bloom in harem bowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced upon the jewels rich that gemmed her shining hair,<br>
       And wreathed her sculptured, snowy arms, her neck and brow so fair.<br>
       Their lustre softened not the pangs that filled that lonely hour,<br>
       More happy was she when her braids were decked with simple flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, Azof, did not thought of him some passing joy impart;<br>
       Did not the memory of his love bring gladness to her heart?<br>
       Alas, that long and heavy sigh, the glitt&rsquo;ring tear that fell<br>
       From &rsquo;neath her dark and drooping lids, told more than words could
      tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Awhile she weeps, and then a change steals o&rsquo;er her mournful
      dream,<br>
       Her gloomy thoughts are chased away, and all things brighter seem,<br>
       A timid and yet blissful smile lights up her beauteous brow,<br>
       Her soft cheek crimsons, but, oh&rsquo; not of Azof thinks she now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perchance of some gallant Greek she knew in life&rsquo;s young hour,<br>
       Some childish love as guileless as her love for bird or flower,<br>
       But which, looked back on through the mist of absence or of time,<br>
       Seemed sad and sweet as are the words&mdash;of some old childish rhyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could he, her royal lover, now but look into her heart,<br>
       And read its depths, how sharp the pang that knowledge would impart,<br>
       But no, secure in certain bliss, he deems her all his own,<br>
       And prides himself that girlish heart loves him and him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sadness which might have awaked suspicion or mistrust,<br>
       Was of the spells she swayed him by, the dearest and the
      first,&mdash;<br>
       He deemed it but the token of a timid gentle heart,<br>
       That ever kept from needless show or noisy mirth apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew not that the voice which now sang but some mournful lay<br>
       Breathed once the soul of joyousness, was gayest of the gay,<br>
       That the soft laugh whose magic power his very heart strings
      stirred,<br>
       Though now so rare, in girlhood&rsquo;s home had oftentimes been heard!
    </p>
    <p>
      Th&rsquo; averted head, the timid look the half unwilling ear,<br>
       With which she met his vows of love, he deemed but girlish fear,<br>
       Nor ever dreamed that she whom all considered as thrice blessed,<br>
       Whose life was like a summer day loved, honored and caressed;
    </p>
    <p>
      Who held, a captive to her charms, a most accomplished knight<br>
       And monarch brave that ever yet had bowed to woman&rsquo;s might<br>
       Was but a poor and joyless slave, compelled to wear a smile<br>
       And act a part for which she loathed her wretched self the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, like some fair exotic brought unto a foreign strand,<br>
       She lost her bloom and pined to see once more her native land,<br>
       And only when from earthly scenes death summoned her to part<br>
       A blissful smile played round her lips, and peace was in her heart.

      Oh! gladly do we welcome thee,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Fair pleasant month of May;<br>
       Month which we&rsquo;ve eager longed to see,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Through many a wintry day:<br>
       And now with countless budding flowers,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;With sunshine bright and clear&mdash;<br>

      But, yet, we do not welcome thee<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Because thy genial breath<br>
       Hath power our sleeping land to free<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;From winter&rsquo;s clasp of death;<br>
       Nor yet because fair flowers are springing<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath thy genial ray;<br>
       And thousand happy birds are singing<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;All welcome to thee, May!

      No, higher, nobler cause have we<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;The mother of God&rsquo;s son.

      The blossoms that we joyous cull<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;By bank or silver stream;<br>
       The fragrant hawthorn boughs we pull,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Most sacred too, we deem:<br>
       For not amid our tresses we<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Their op&rsquo;ning buds will twine,<br>

      <a name="lyrical16">MAUDE.</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A BALLAD OF THE OLDEN TIME.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Around the castle turrets fiercely moaned the autumn blast,<br>
       And within the old lords daughter seemed dying, dying fast;<br>
       While o&rsquo;er her couch in frenzied grief the stricken father
      bent,<br>
       And in deep sobs and stifled moans his anguish wild found vent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh cheer thee up, my daughter dear, my Maude, he softly said,<br>
       As tremblingly he strove to raise that young and drooping head;<br>
       &rsquo;I&rsquo;ll deck thee out in jewels rare in robes of silken
      sheen,<br>
       Till thou shalt be as rich and gay as any crowned queen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, never, never!&rdquo; sighed the girl, and her pale cheek paler
      grew,<br>
       While marble brow and chill white hands were bathed in icy dew;<br>
       &ldquo;Look in my face&mdash;there thou wilt read such hopes are folly
      all,<br>
       No garment shall I wear again, save shroud and funeral pall.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Maude thou&rsquo;rt wilful! Far away in lands beyond the
      sea<br>
       Are sunny climes, where winter ne&rsquo;er doth wither flower or
      tree;<br>
       And there thou&rsquo;lt journey with me, till I see thee smile once
      more,<br>
       And thy fair cheek wear the rose&rsquo;s hue as in the days of
      yore.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no roses shall I gather beneath a summer sky,<br>
       Not for me such dreams, dear father, my end is drawing nigh;<br>
       One voyage is before me, &rsquo;tis no use to grieve or moan,<br>
       But that dark, fearful journey must I travel all alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My precious child! last of my race! why wilt thou grieve me
      so?<br>
       Why add by such sad words unto thy grey haired father&rsquo;s woe?<br>
       Live&mdash;live, my pearl! my stricken dove! earth&rsquo;s joys shall
      all be thine;<br>
       Whate&rsquo;er thy wish or will through life, it also shall be
      mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast coursed the diamond tear drops down that fair, though faded,
      cheek,<br>
       And she whispered, but so softly, one scarce could hear her speak:<br>
       &ldquo;Ah! father, half those loving cares when summer bright was
      here<br>
       Would have kept thy daughter with thee for many a happy year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, ah! thy heart was marble then, and to thy direst foe,<br>
       More stern, relentless anger thou couldst not, father, show.<br>
       What was my crime? The one I loved, not rich but nobly born,<br>
       Was loyal, true, on whom no man e&rsquo;er looked with glance of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wooed me fairly, father dear, but thou did&rsquo;st often
      swear<br>
       Thou&rsquo;dst rather see me in my grave than bride to Hengist&rsquo;s
      heir.<br>
       Reckless, despairing, he embarked upon the stormy main,<br>
       To seek an end to grief and care, nor sought he long in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm and untroubled sleeps he now beneath the salt sea brine,<br>
       And I rejoice to think how soon that sweet sleep shall be
      mine!&rdquo;<br>
       No answer made the father but a low and grief-struck moan;<br>
       And silence reigned again throughout that chamber sad and lone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sudden the girl starts wildly, with bright and kindling eye,<br>
       Her cheek assumes a crimson tint like hue of sunset sky,<br>
       &ldquo;Father! that voice, that rapid step, ah, me! they are
      well-known,<br>
       Hengist who comes from ocean&rsquo;s deeps to claim me for his
      own!&rdquo;
    </p>

       Bending above her, whisp&rsquo;ring low, fond word and tender vow:<br>
       &ldquo;Maude, my own love! no spectral form, no phantom&rsquo;s at thy

      The story runs that love and youth o&rsquo;er death the victory won,<br>
       And again did Maude, a happy wife, play &rsquo;neath the summer sun,<br>
       While the old lord, grateful to the Power that Hengist&rsquo;s life had
      spared,<br>
       Henceforth in all his children&rsquo;s bliss, hopes, sorrows, fully

      O when will it end, this appalling strife,<br>
       With its reckless waste of human life,<br>
       Its riving of highest, holiest ties,<br>
       Its tears of anguish and harrowing sighs,<br>

       Sole stay of frail children and helpless wife;<br>
       The bright-eyed, ardent, and beardless boy,<br>

      The moon from solemn azure sky<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Looked down on earth below,<br>
       And coldly her wan light fell alike<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;On scenes of joy and woe:<br>
       A stately palace reared its dome,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Within reigned warmth and light<br>
       And festive mirth&mdash;the moon&rsquo;s faint rays<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Soft kissed its marble white.

    <p>
      A little farther was the home<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of toil, alas! and want,<br>
       That spectre grim that countless hearths<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Seems ceaselessly to haunt;<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled on that drear spot,<br>
       Silvering brightly the ruined eaves<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And roof of that poor cot.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, with curious gaze, she looked<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Within a curtained loom,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;In the morrow&rsquo;s solemn hour.

    <p>
      With changeless smile she gleamed within<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;A casement, gloomy, lone,<br>
       Where lay a cold and rigid form,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;A death bed stretched upon.<br>
       The fixed gaze of the half closed eyes,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;The forehead chill and white,<br>
       The shroud and pall, more ghastly looked,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped thus in still, silv&rsquo;ry light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long, sadly, gazed I, then a thought,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp, bitter, filled my heart<br>
       &rsquo;Gainst that cold orb, which in our joys<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And sorrows took no part;<br>
       Which shone as bright o&rsquo;er couch of death,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;In prison&rsquo;s darkened gloom,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;Or stately palace room.

    <p>
      An inward voice reproved the thought,<br>

      Ah, useless chiding! The loved ones tender,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Who shared my rambles long ago,<br>
       Whose cherished accents could only render<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Words of affection soft and low,<br>

      &rsquo;Tis thus this hour of gentle even<br>

       Loved ones with whom this earth was Heaven<br>

       With its hopes full of golden promise<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;For some sure, distant day.

    <p>
      And he vowed, as his dark eye kindled,<br>

       And conquer with mind or weapon<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;A proud, undying name.<br>

       Flooded mountain top and valley and the low clouds overhead;<br>
       And the rays streamed through the windows of a building stately,
      high,<br>
       Whose wealthy, high-born master had lain him down to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many friends were thronging round him, breathing aching, heavy
      sighs&mdash;<br>
       Men with pale and awe-struck faces, women, too, with weeping eyes,<br>
       Watching breathless, silent, grieving him whose sands were nearly
      run,<br>
       When, with sudden start, he muttered: &ldquo;God! how much I&rsquo;ve
      left undone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then out spoke an aged listener, with broad brow and locks of snow,<br>
       &ldquo;Patriot, faithful to thy country and her welfare, say not so,<br>
       For the long years thou hast served her thou hast only honor

       But, from side to side still tossing, still he muttered: &ldquo;Much
      undone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the wife, with moan of anguish, like complaint of stricken dove,<br>
       Murmured: &ldquo;Husband, truer, fonder, never blessed a woman&rsquo;s
      love,<br>
       And a just and tender father both to daughter and to
      son&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
       But more feebly moaned he ever: &ldquo;Oh! there&rsquo;s much,
      there&rsquo;s much undone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly, then, a proud, stern soldier questioned: &ldquo;Say, will not
      thy name<br>
       Long descend in future story, linked with honor and with fame,<br>
       For thine arm was prompt in battle and thy laurels nobly won;<br>
       Patriot, citizen and soldier, what, then, is there left undone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the dying man upraised him; at his accents loud and clear<br>
       Into silence men lapsed quickly&mdash;women checked each sob and
      tear;<br>
       And he said: &ldquo;To fame, home, country, all my heart, my thoughts

       But, Oh dreamers, can you tell me what I&rsquo;ve done for God&mdash;for

      &ldquo;It was not for Him I battled with the sword or with the pen,<br>

       And amid the light now flooding this my life&rsquo;s last setting

    <p>
      Thicker, darker, fell the shadows, fainter grew his flutt&rsquo;ring
      breath<br>
       Then a strange and solemn stillness, &rsquo;twas the awful hush of
      death:<br>

      Yet, were I there, oh! well I know the time would surely come<br>
       When my yearning heart would turn again to my far Canadian home,<br>
       Longing to look once more upon its wintry wastes of snow,<br>
       And the friends whose hearts throb like mine own, with
      friendship&rsquo;s changeless glow.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Other harvests there are than those that lie<br>
       Glowing and ripe &rsquo;neath an autumn sky,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting the sickle keen,<br>
       Harvests more precious than golden grain,<br>
       Waving o&rsquo;er hillside, valley or plain,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Than fruits &rsquo;mid their leafy screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not alone for the preacher, man of God,<br>
       Do those harvests vast enrich the sod,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;For all may the sickle wield;<br>
       The first in proud ambition&rsquo;s race,<br>
       The last in talent, power or place,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Will all find work in that field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man toiling, lab&rsquo;ring with fevered strain,<br>
       High office or golden prize to gain,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Rest both weary heart and head,<br>
       And think, when thou&rsquo;lt shudder in death&rsquo;s cold clasp,<br>
       How earthly things will elude thy grasp,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;At that harvest work instead!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady, with queenly form and brow,<br>
       Gems decking thy neck and arms of snow,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Who need only smile to win;<br>
       &rsquo;Mid thy guests, perchance the gay, the grave,<br>
       Is one whom a warning word might save<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;From folly, sorrow or sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let that word be said, thine eyes so bright<br>
       Will glow with holier, softer light<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;For the good that thou hast done;<br>
       And a time will come when thou wilt reap<br>
       From that simple act more pleasure deep<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Than from flatt&rsquo;ring conquests won.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young girl in thy bright youth&rsquo;s blushing dawn,<br>
       Graceful and joyous as sportive fawn,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;There is work for thee to do,<br>
       And higher aims than to flirt and smile,<br>
       And practise each gay, coquettish wile,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Admiring glances to woo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! the world is full of grief and care,<br>
       Sad, breaking hearts are every where,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And thou can&rsquo;st give relief;<br>
       Alms to the needy&mdash;soft word of hope<br>
       That a brighter view may chance to ope<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;To mourners bowed by grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      That gauzy tissue yon bud or flower<br>
       That tempt thee at the present hour,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;To be worn, then cast aside,<br>
       Bethink thee, their price might comfort bring,<br>
       Fuel or food to the famishing<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And help to the sorely tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such harvest fruits are most precious and rare,<br>
       Worthy all toil and patient care,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the promised reward!<br>
       Not earthly gains that will pass away<br>
       Like morning mist or bright sunset ray,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;But Christ Himself, our Lord!

       Men of high science and of skill<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;With aching heart and brain.<br>
       The fever burning in her veins<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;No borrowed bloom to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The masses of her raven hair<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Fall down on either side<br>
       In tangled richness&mdash;it has been<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Through life her care and pride;<br>
       And those small perfect hands on which<br>

    <p>
      Sad was her restless, fev&rsquo;rish sleep,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;More sad her waking still,<br>
       As with wild start she looks around<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Her chamber darkened&mdash;still;<br>
       Its silence and the mournful looks<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of those who stand apart,<br>
       Some awful fear seem to suggest<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;To that poor worldly heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, I&rsquo;m better, am I not?&rdquo;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;She gasps with failing breath&mdash;<br>
       Alas! the answer sternly tells<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That she is &ldquo;ill to death.&rdquo;<br>
       &ldquo;What! dying!&rdquo; and her eyes gleam forth<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;A flashing, fearful ray,<br>
       &ldquo;I, young, rich, lovely, from this earth<br>

       Breathless she listens, but no word<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Breaks that dull pause of grief,&mdash;<br>
       Her pitying listeners turn away,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;They cannot give relief

      Tossing aloft, in fierce despair,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;I must not, will not die.&rdquo;<br>
       But One can grant that wild appeal,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Can stay her failing breath&mdash;<br>
       Of Him she never thought in life<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor thinks she now in death.

    <p>
      Without one prayer, one contrite tear,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;For past faults to atone&mdash;<br>
       For wasted talents, misspent life,<br>

      <a name="lyrical04">THE CHOICE OF SWEET SHY CLARE.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fair as a wreath of fresh spring flowers, a band of maidens lay<br>
       On the velvet sward&mdash;enjoying the golden summer day;<br>
       And many a ringing silv&rsquo;ry laugh on the calm air clearly fell,<br>
       With fancies sweet, which their rosy lips, half unwilling, seemed to
      tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke, as maidens often speak, of that ideal one<br>
       By whom the wealth of their warm young hearts will at length be wooed
      and won&mdash;<br>
       Fond girlish dreams! and half in jest and half in serious strain,<br>
       Each told of the gifts that could alone the prize of her love obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first who spoke was a bright-eyed girl, with a form of airy
      grace,<br>
       Mirth beaming in every dimple sweet of her joyous smiling face:<br>
       &ldquo;I ask not much in the favor&rsquo;d one who this dainty hand
      would gain;&mdash;<br>
       No ordeal long would I ask of him&mdash;no hours of mental pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him but come in the pomp of rank, endowed with wealth and
      pride,<br>
       To woo to a lofty palace home his youthful, worshipped bride,<br>
       Heaping my path with presents rare, with radiant jewels and
      gold,&mdash;<br>
       Love&rsquo;s flame &rsquo;neath poverty&rsquo;s breath, &rsquo;tis said,
      soon waxes faint and cold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Outspoke another, with proud dark eye, and a stately, regal mien:<br>
       &ldquo;Thou saidst thou wast easily pleased, May, and so thou art, I
      ween,<br>
       Thou askest paltry rank and wealth&mdash;aim higher would be mine!<br>
       Rare mental gold&mdash;the priceless fire of genius divine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said a third, with soft sweet voice, &ldquo;would
      exact still less than ye,<br>
       No need for glitter of lofty state, no gold or jewels for me;<br>
       Nor ask I that genius&rsquo; lofty power in his ardent soul should
      dwell,<br>
       Enough, if he love but me alone, and love me only well!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another said that her choice would fall on manly beauty and grace,<br>
       That he she would love must matchless stand, the noblest of his
      race,<br>
       Excelling in sports of flood and field, and as lion brave in war,<br>
       Yet, with hand and voice, in lady&rsquo;s bower, attuned to light
      guitar.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, with one accord, they turned to a dove-like maiden mild,<br>
       With a seraph&rsquo;s purity of look, and soft graces of a child;<br>
       &ldquo;Speak out, speak out now, sweet shy Clare, we anxious wait for
      thee,<br>
       Coy, gentle one! fear not to say what thy heart&rsquo;s young choice
      will be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment paused she, and then a flush, like sunset, dyed her brow,<br>
       And softly she murmured &ldquo;Sisters, dear, I have made my choice ere
      now,<br>
       And the rarest gifts that you could name, be they earthly or divine.<br>
       In strange perfection&mdash;God like grace&mdash;will be found all, all
      in mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She ceased, and a thoughtful silence stole o&rsquo;er those youthful
      brows of mirth,<br>
       They knew she spoke of the Bridegroom King&mdash;the Lord of Heaven and
      earth;<br>
       And e&rsquo;er fleet time of another year had sounded the passing
      knell,<br>
       The maiden Clare and her Bridegroom fair were wedded in convent cell.

       The music is hushed, the revellers gone,<br>
       The glitt&rsquo;ring ball-room deserted and lone,&mdash;<br>
       Silence and gloom, like a clinging pall,<br>

      Amid the flowers of a garden glade<br>

       And the sunbeams shone, the zephyrs played,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Round the gardens favorite child;<br>
       And the diamond dew-drops glistening fell<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;On each rose&rsquo;s silken vest,<br>
       Whilst light winged bee and butterfly gay<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;On the soft leaves loved to rest.

      But one morn while a sunbeam bright<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Lit up its delicate bloom,<br>
       And a zephyr lightly hovered &rsquo;round,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;On wings of sweet perfume,<br>
       A strong hand came, and ruthlessly<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Tore up the parent tree,<br>
       And bore it off, with each fair young rose,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;From butterfly, zephyr and bee.

       With priceless marbles paintings rare,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Adorned its prison room?

       And its young head daily lowlier drooped<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Upon its sorrowing breast,<br>
       While it chafed against the kindly hand<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That tended and caressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Autumn came with angry storms,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;With clouded and wintry skies&mdash;<br>
       Rudely it touched the lovely flowers,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And withered their brilliant dyes;<br>
       The sunbeam false hid its glowing glance,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Or with chilling coldness shone;<br>
       The zephyr fled to Southern climes,<br>

       No more it mourned past Summer joys,<br>

      Fair tiny rosebud! what a tide<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of hidden joy, o&rsquo;erpow&rsquo;ring, deep,<br>
       Of grateful love, of woman&rsquo;s pride,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Thrills through my heart till I must weep<br>

       And, dreaming of far distant days,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;With mother&rsquo;s weakness strive to trace<br>

      The snow-flakes were softly falling<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Adown on the landscape white,<br>
       When the violet eyes of my first born<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Opened unto the light;<br>
       And I thought as I pressed him to me,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;With loving, rapturous thrill,<br>
       He was pure and fair as the snow-flakes<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That lay on the landscape still.
    </p>
    <p>
      I smiled when they spoke of the weary<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Length of the winter&rsquo;s night,<br>
       Of the days so short and so dreary,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sun&rsquo;s cold cheerless light&mdash;<br>
       I listened, but in their murmurs<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor by word nor thought took part,<br>
       For the smiles of my gentle darling<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Brought light to my home and heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! quickly the joyous springtime<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Came back to our ice-bound earth,<br>
       Filling meadows and woods with sunshine,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And hearts with gladsome mirth,<br>
       But, ah! on earth&rsquo;s dawning beauty<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;There rested a gloomy shade,<br>
       For our tiny household blossom<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Began to droop and fade.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I, shuddering, felt that the frailest<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of the flowers in the old woods dim<br>
       Had a surer hold on existence<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Than I dared to hope for him.<br>
       In the flush of the summer&rsquo;s beauty<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;On a sunny, golden day,<br>
       When flowers gemmed dell and upland,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;My darling passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I chafed at the brilliant sunshine<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That flooded my lonely room,<br>
       Now I wearied of bounteous Nature,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;So full of life and bloom;<br>
       I regretted the wintry hours<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;With the snow-flakes falling fast,<br>
       And the little form of my nursling<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;With his arms around me cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      They laid his tiny garment<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;In an attic chamber high,<br>
       His coral, his empty cradle,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That they might not meet my eye;<br>
       And his name was never uttered,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;What e&rsquo;er each heart might feel,<br>
       For they wished the wound in my bosom<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Might have tune to close and heal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has done so thanks to that Power<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That has been my earthly stay,<br>
       And should you talk of my darling,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;I could listen now all day,<br>
       For I know that each passing minute<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Brings me nearer life&rsquo;s last shore,<br>

       Yes, dead&mdash;and spared the ills of life, and in bright bliss

      <a name="hearth05">A GIRL&rsquo;S DAY DREAM AND ITS FULFILMENT.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child of my love, why wearest thou<br>
       That pensive look and thoughtful brow?<br>
       Can&rsquo;st gaze abroad on this world so fair<br>
       And yet thy glance be fraught with care?<br>
       Roses still bloom in glowing dyes,<br>
       Sunshine still fills our summer skies,<br>
       Earth is still lovely, nature glad&mdash;<br>
       Why dost thou look so lone and sad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! mother it once sufficed thy child<br>
       To cherish a bird or flow&rsquo;ret wild;<br>
       To see the moonbeams the waters kiss,<br>
       Was enough to fill her heart with bliss;<br>
       Or o&rsquo;er the bright woodland stream to bow,<br>
       But these things may not suffice her now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps &rsquo;tis music thou seekest, child?<br>
       Then list the notes of the song birds wild,<br>
       The gentle voice of the mountain breeze,<br>
       Whispering among the dark pine trees,<br>
       The surge sublime of the sounding main,<br>
       Or thy own loved lute&rsquo;s soft silvery strain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, there&rsquo;s music sweeter I know<br>
       Than bird&rsquo;s soft note or than ocean&rsquo;s flow,<br>
       Vague to me yet as sounds of a dream,<br>
       Yet dearer, brighter than sunshine&rsquo;s gleam;<br>
       Such is the music I fain would hear,<br>
       All other sounds but tire mine ear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! thou seekest then a loving heart,<br>
       That in all thy griefs will bear a part,<br>
       That shelter will give in doubt and fear,<br>
       Come to me, loved one, thou&rsquo;lt find it here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet mother, I almost fear to speak,<br>
       And remorseful blushes dye my cheek,<br>
       For though thou&rsquo;st watched me from childhood&rsquo;s hour,<br>
       As thou would&rsquo;st have done a precious flower,<br>
       Though I love thee still as I did of yore,<br>
       Yet this weak heart seeketh something more:
    </p>
    <p>
      A bliss as yet to my life unknown,<br>
       A heart whose throbs will be all mine own,<br>
       The tender tones of a cherished voice,<br>
       Of him who shall be my heart&rsquo;s first choice;<br>
       And who at my feet alone shall bow,<br>
       This, this is the dream that haunts me now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, poor child, has it come to this?<br>
       Then bid farewell to thy childhood&rsquo;s bliss,<br>
       To thy girlhood&rsquo;s bright unfettered hours,<br>
       Thy sunny revels &rsquo;mid birds and flowers;<br>
       Of the golden zone yield up each strand<br>
       To cling to a hope, unstable as sand,<br>
       And forget the joys thy youth hath wove<br>
       In the stormy doubts of human love,<br>
       The feverish hopes and wearing pain<br>
       That form the links of Love&rsquo;s bright chain!&rdquo;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! the mother spoke in vain!
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s dream was soon fulfilled,<br>
       Her hopes by no dark cloud were chilled;<br>
       A lover ardent, noble too,<br>
       With flashing eyes of jetty hue,<br>
       With voice like music, sweet and soft,<br>
       Such as her dreams had pictured oft,<br>
       Now at her feet, a suppliant bowed,<br>
       And love eternal, changeless vowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listening, then, with glowing cheek,<br>
       And rapture which no words might speak,<br>
       She thought, with bright and joyous smile,<br>
       They erred who thus could love revile,<br>
       Or say it had many a dark alloy,&mdash;<br>
       Had it not proved a dream of joy?
    </p>
    <p>
      But, alas for her! she learned too soon<br>
       That love is fleeting as rose of June,<br>
       That her eyes might shine with olden light,<br>
       And yet be found no longer bright;<br>
       That she might devoted, faithful prove,<br>
       Yet her lover grow weary of her love.<br>
       Many an hour of silent tears,<br>
       Of heart-sick doubts, of humbling fears,<br>
       Of angry regrets, were hers, before<br>
       Her heart would say, &ldquo;He loves no more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Weary of life and its thorny ways,<br>
       She sought the friend of her early days:<br>
       &ldquo;Mother, I bring thee a breaking heart,<br>
       In sorrows deep it hath borne a part;<br>
       Speak to me tenderly as of yore,<br>
       Let thy kiss rest on my brow once more;<br>
       To the joys of my girlhood back I flee,<br>
       To live alone for them and for thee!&rdquo;

      CHILD.</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Young mother! proudly throbs thine heart, and well may it rejoice,<br>
       Well may&rsquo;st thou raise to Heaven above in grateful prayer thy
      voice:<br>
       A gift hath been bestowed on thee, a gift of priceless worth,<br>
       Far dearer to thy woman&rsquo;s heart than all the wealth of earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      What store of deep and holy joy is opened to thy thought&mdash;<br>
       Glad, sunny dreams of future days, with bliss and rapture fraught;<br>
       Of hopes as varied, yet as bright, as beams of April sun,<br>
       And plans and wishes centred all within thy darling one!
    </p>
    <p>
      While others seek in changing scenes earth&rsquo;s happiness to gain,<br>
       In fashion&rsquo;s halls to win a joy as dazzling as &rsquo;tis
      vain&mdash;<br>
       A bliss more holy far is thine, far sweeter and more deep,<br>
       To watch beside thine infant&rsquo;s couch and bend above his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      What joy for thee to ling&rsquo;ring gaze within those cloudless
      eyes,<br>
       Turning upon thee with a glance of such sweet, strange surprise,<br>
       Or press a mother&rsquo;s loving kiss upon that fair, white brow,<br>
       Of all earth&rsquo;s weight of sin and care and pain unconscious now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as thy loved one&rsquo;s sleeping breath so softly fans thy
      cheek,<br>
       And gazing on that tiny form, so lovely, yet so weak,<br>
       A dream comes o&rsquo;er thee of the time when nobly at thy side<br>
       Thy cherished son shall proudly stand, in manhood&rsquo;s lofty pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet a sad change steals slowly o&rsquo;er thy tender, loving eye,<br>
       Thou twin&rsquo;st him closer to thy heart, with fond and anxious
      sigh,<br>
       Feeling, however bright his course he too must suff&rsquo;ring know,<br>
       Like all earth&rsquo;s children taste alike life&rsquo;s cup of care and
      woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, oh! it lies within thy power to give to him a spell<br>
       To guard him in the darkest hour from sorrow safe and well;<br>
       Thou&rsquo;lt find it in the narrow path the great and good have

       &nbsp;&nbsp;The treasures thou graspest tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pretty pebble, a tiny shell,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;A feather by wild bird cast,<br>
       Gay flowers gathered in forest dell,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Already withering fast,<br>
       Four speckled eggs in a soft brown nest,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy last and thy greatest prize,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;Task aching heart and brain,<br>
       Waste yearning hopes and anxious fears<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;On baubles just as vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      For empty title, ribbon or star,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;And suffer toils untold;<br>
       Plodding their narrow and earth-bound way<br>

       Wasting not merely a fleeting day,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;But the precious years of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thou, fair child, with to-morrow&rsquo;s dawn<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Wilt rise up calm and glad,<br>
       To cull wild flowers &rsquo;mid wood and lawn,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Untroubled by memory sad;<br>
       But, alas! the worldly-wise of earth,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;When life&rsquo;s last bonds are riven,<br>
       Will find that for things of meanest worth<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;ve lost both Life and Heaven.

    </h2>
    <p>
      They grew together side by side,<br>
       They filled one house with glee<br>
       Their graves are severed far and wide&mdash;<br>
       By mountain stream and tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hemans
    </p>
    <p>
      They were as fair and bright a band as ever filled with pride<br>
       Parental hearts whose task it was children beloved to guide;<br>
       And every care that love upon its idols bright may shower<br>
       Was lavished with impartial hand upon each fair young flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theirs was the father&rsquo;s merry hour sharing their childish
      bliss,<br>
       The mother&rsquo;s soft breathed benison and tender, nightly kiss;<br>
       While strangers who by chance might see their joyous graceful play,<br>
       To breathe some word of fondness kind would pause upon their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But years rolled on, and in their course Time many changes brought,<br>
       And sorrow in that household gay his silent power wrought!<br>
       The sons had grown to gallant men of lofty heart and brow,<br>
       The fairy like and joyous girls were thoughtful women now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour of changes had arrived, and slowly, one by one,<br>
       The playmates left the parent&rsquo;s roof, their own career to run;<br>
       The eldest born, the mother&rsquo;s choice, whose soft and holy
      smile<br>
       In childhood&rsquo;s days had told of heart as angel&rsquo;s free from
      guile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formed in resolve, and scorning all earth&rsquo;s pleasures and its
      fame,<br>
       Had offered up his life to God, a teacher of His name:<br>
       His spirit sighed not long on earth, he found a quiet grave<br>
       &rsquo;Mid forests wild whose shades he&rsquo;d sought the Red
      man&rsquo;s soul to save.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far diff&rsquo;rent was the stirring choice of his youthful brother
      gay,<br>
       His was the glitt&rsquo;ring sword and flag, the drum, the war
      steed&rsquo;s neigh;<br>
       And the proud spirit that had marked his childhood&rsquo;s earliest
      hour<br>
       Distinguished still the warrior brave in manhood&rsquo;s lofty power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas for him, and visions vain of fame that lured him on,<br>
       An early grave in a distant land was the only goal he won!<br>
       His gaze bedimmed that yearned for home rested on alien skies,<br>
       And alien watchers wiped death&rsquo;s damps, and closed his dying eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third with buoyant heart, had sought far India&rsquo;s burning
      soil,<br>
       Thinking to win wealth&rsquo;s treasures by a few years&rsquo; eager
      toil,<br>
       But ere those years had sped their course, from earth&rsquo;s cares he
      was free,&mdash;<br>
       He sleeps beneath the shadow of the date and mango tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sisters who had brightened once the home now desolate&mdash;<br>
       Lived they to mourn each brother&rsquo;s loss? was theirs a happier
      fate?<br>
       In childhood&rsquo;s sports and youth&rsquo;s high dreams they&rsquo;d
      borne a happy part,<br>
       But severed they were doomed ere long in death to sleep apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall and dark-eyed girl whose laugh, so full of silvery glee,<br>
       Had ever told of spirit light, from care and shadow free,<br>
       Had early left her happy home, the bright and envied bride<br>
       Of a husband whose ancestral name betokened wealth and pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas for her who in youth&rsquo;s hour had basked in love&rsquo;s
      sunshine,<br>
       That husband stern deserted her in cold neglect to pine;<br>
       The merry smile soon fled her lip, the sparkling light her eye,<br>
       In vain she sought a southern clime, she only went to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now of all the lovely band who&rsquo;d joined in mirth of old,<br>
       There is, alas! but one sweet flower whose tale remains untold:<br>
       She was the joy, the pride of all, that gentle girl, and
      fair,&mdash;<br>
       With deep and dreamy azure eyes and shining golden hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      E&rsquo;en her bold brothers, in their youth, were gentle when she
      played,<br>
       From reckless sports, from daring games their eager hands they
      stayed;<br>
       And when amid their thoughtless mirth harsh feelings might awake,<br>
       They ever yielded to her prayers, and rested for her sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! hers was far the brightest lot in life&rsquo;s eventful race!<br>
       She passed from earth ere care had left upon her brow one
      trace&mdash;<br>
       She passed from earth with loving ones grouped round her dying bed,<br>
       And on a mother&rsquo;s tender breast rested her throbbing head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &rsquo;Twas thus that each beloved one of that bright joyous band,<br>
       Save her, had found a lonely grave in a far distant land;<br>
       Yet murmurs &rsquo;gainst high heaven&rsquo;s decrees as impious were as
      vain&mdash;<br>
       For in far happier regions will that household meet again!

       &nbsp;&nbsp;Within my chamber still,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;Each gloomy angle fill,<br>
       And my worn and weary watchers<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce dare to move or weep,<br>
       For they think that I am buried<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;In deep and quiet sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, hush! what are those voices<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Heard on the midnight air,<br>
       Of strange celestial sweetness,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing of love and prayer?<br>
       Nearer they grow and clearer,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;I hear now what they say&mdash;<br>
       To the Kingdom of God&rsquo;s glory,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;re calling me away!
    </p>
    <p>
      See my gentle mother softly<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;To me approaches now,<br>
       What is the change she readeth<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my pale damp brow?<br>
       She clasps her hands in anguish<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Whose depth no words might say?<br>
       Has she, too, heard the voices<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That are calling me away?
    </p>
    <p>
      The father fond of my children,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;First sole love of my youth,<br>
       The loving, the gentle hearted,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;And full of manly truth,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp;Beseeching me to stay&mdash;<br>
       Oh! &rsquo;tis agony to tell him<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;re calling me away.
    </p>
    <p>
      If earthly love could conquer<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty power of Death,<br>
       <i>His</i> love would stay the current<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Of failing strength and breath!<br>
       That voice whose tender fondness<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;So long has been my stay<br>
       Should tempt me from the voices<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That are calling me away.

    <p>
      Ah! they bring my children to me,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;That loved and lovely band,<br>
       And with wistful awe-struck faces,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Around my couch they stand,<br>
       And I strain each gentle darling<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;To me with wailing cry,<br>
       As I for the first time murmur:<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My God! &rsquo;tis hard to die!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, O hark! Those strains of Heaven,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Sound louder in mine ear,<br>
       Whisp&rsquo;ring: &ldquo;Thy God, Thy Father,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Will guard those children dear.&rdquo;<br>
       Louder they grow, now drowning<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;All sounds of mortal birth,<br>
       And in wild triumphant sweetness<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Bear me aloft from earth!

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
